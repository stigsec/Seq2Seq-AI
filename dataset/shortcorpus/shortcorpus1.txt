Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Do you think she might be interested in someone?
Which one?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the TwentyFourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
Stuart?
Yes.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Right. Bombardier, to me please.
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
But will they make good use of them?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is NorrisNewman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Thank you.
Yes?
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Certainly, Sin
Splendid horsemanship Who are they?
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Excellent. Thank you. Give them to Crealock, would you?
My Lord. This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
I'm explaining my reasons.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Excuse me, My Lord. NorrisNewman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be should be at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the teawater this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
Could be. Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us and wait and find our weaknesses.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Food!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!!
I'm sorry, sir. We only seat by reservation.
Drink!
Oh, no siree. If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to maloo.
Foooooood!
Now just one moment. There's no need for roughhousing. Have you ever tried a tip?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Franz! Help! Lunatic!
No, not sound.
There must have been someone else down here then.
His what??
His schwanzstucker.
Whew! A nineteeninch drill.
It's working! Oh, Doctor  you play beautifully.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
I'm getting tired.
Why don't we all turn in? It's been a long day.
Look how far we've come.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Why certainly. Don't you, Frau Blucher?
How do you know they're done?
The doctor said to allow seven minutes: no more and no less  or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
How long is it so far?
Four
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, Igor  I'm so afraid! I just hope this all ends well.
Igor  are you sure the monster has a good brain? Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Absolutely! May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
INGA +++$+++
Sounds like visitors. It's all right  Frau Blucher will show them in.
Oh, must be around ten... tenthirty.
Igor  the clock! Hurry!
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Do Something! Stall them!
Extremely well.
How nice.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Yes, thank you. It wasn't bad.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Are you busy?
That's quite all right. What is it, dear?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while? I just can't sleep.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away. It must be the strange room.
Well...
Oh please  just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Would you like a sandwich?
No, thanks! I want to get right to sleep.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
Inga!
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Inga, wake up!
What is it? Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen! Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes! What could it be at this hour?
I don't know. It just woke me up.
Dr. Fronkonsteen  look!
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there. I'm going down to see.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please! I don't want to stay up here alone.
All right then, quietly! Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Ooh!
What a filthy mess.
Look, Doctor!
Well, this explains the music.
But who was playing it?
Oh, doctor!
Perhaps we'd better leave.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course! That would simplify everything.
And look at this, Doctor!
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
A god?
Yes!
I know.
Right here?
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh! Yes, Doctor.
Reputation. Reputation!
I thought it was wonderful.
I don't understand  I followed the notes to the letter.
It wasn't me.
Look here  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Oh, Doctor!
I think you've done it, master.
Alive! Look at it. I have defeated death!
It looks that way.
What do you think we should do?
What are you going to do?
I think I'll...carry him.
Do you think you can sing it?
Me? Sing?
Yes  quickly, dear!
I'd be so nervous.
This is not the finals  just sing!
It's something daring, 'The Continental,' A way of dancing that's really ultra new; It's very subtle, 'The Continental.'
It has a passion, 'The Conti nental...'
Stop  singing!!!
All right  give it to him!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Oh! Yes, Doctor.
Did you do it?
I think so.
Good! It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Wonderful? It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
Just passing through the night.
What's wrong, Doctor? You seem... lonely.
Oh, a little. But it's not just physical loneliness. It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
It's terrible  the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
Not fooling around.
I know, but I mean  not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I see what you mean.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I know Frederick.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
Of course not.
What?
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Nor to Elizabeth.
No. Nor to Elizabeth.
We all have our feelings. I know that I have mine. And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
Yes, I have mine.
And I have mine.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Why don't we talk inside?
Well... ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Yes, I know.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Yes, I will.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this  we could have as often as we wanted. Three times a day  anything!
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
MMmmm.
MMMMmmmmm!
Yes, sweetie...I heard you. So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
Are you ready for me?
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
I love it when you're excited. Come then, my Apfelstrudel! Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
What's that tune that you're playing
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.
May I see your violin?
It's an honor for me, sir. You play the violin?
Oh, just a little.
Nice! Nice little balance to it.
Ja, ja.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
It's alive!
Hello there.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
I'm going to untie you  can you understand that?
MMMmmmm! MMMmmmm!
Yes, I'm going to set you free. Is the sedative ready?
It's alive. It's  moving! It's  breathing! It's  standing! What is your name?
... It's.
Get the sedative ready!
MMmmm! MMmmm!
Poo  tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Poo  tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Soo  pah doo  per.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
...Super duper. Come let's mix where Rock efellers walk with sticks or 'umber ellas' in their mitts.........................
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
For God's sake  go on! Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur! Sing!!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
Wait! Stop! Don't give them the satisfaction. I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
MMMmmmmmm.
Don't you think I know that? But what are you judging by? Bucharest??? This was always a hick town. They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here. Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer bloated bodies put together?
Frederick Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
No, Fred ereck.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not. It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
You must be Igor.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, that's right. My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together. You and I should have a lot of laughs.
I'm sure we will.
This is Inga. They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
How do you do?
Are these your bags?
Yes, just the two.
Incidentally  I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
What hump?
There.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf! There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
No.
Suit yourself...I'm easy. Better watch out for the wockers.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
Wockers with the knockers???
Go ahead, play dumb! You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Home!
Home.
Down! Get down, you beasts!
I wonder what's got into them?
Ayegor!
Froderick!
What are you doing here?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
But what you were doing?
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
Did you hear that strange music?
It seems that way. You didn't hear any music at all?
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Did you see anyone else down here?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
What is this place?
Must be the music room.
It is! This was my grandfather's private library. Look at this!
'How I Did It.' Good title!
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table. I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
Taking the book along?
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
What a filthy job!
Could be worse!
How?
Could be raining!
Very little decay. With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain. You know what to do!
I have a pretty good idea.
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.
I want that brain.
Was he any good?
Was he any good??? He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
Hmm!
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
That's not bad.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it. What if he's not there?
He only died two weeks ago  I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now. I'll prepare the body.
Oh! May I call you 'Master'?
Why?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
If you like  just hurry!
Thank you, Master.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Yes! It's all written down in the notes. Tie off the kites and come down!
Yes, master. Just don't turn on any radios.
You'd better hurry  I think it's going to rain.
All right... elevate me!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing. We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature. We shall ascend into the Heavens. We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
Tonight?
Yes! When I give the word  throw the first switch!
You've got it, master.
Throw the second switch!
This guy means business.
It's not enough. More! More, do you hear me?
What?
More, do you hear me?
What?
Throw the third switch!
Wait till he sees the bill.
You can't win 'em all.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Cold! Cold and dead!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
You'll be getting me sad next.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to take out my frustration on you. You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
I'm not that sort you know. I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
You're right! Selfpity never got anyone anywhere. Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
Who are you talking to?
To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound  I just asked what it was.
But you did  I just heard it.
It wasn't me.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
I suppose you're right. Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
It's trying to talk. it wants us to take off the straps.
Don't fall for that one.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk  pleading with us. I've got to untie it.
careful, master  you never can tell with these chaps.
Original.
Give  me  your  hand!
Whew! I'm glad that's over with.
You can say that again.
Yes.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Why?
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Repeat it anyway  it's a wonderful cue.
... I'm glad that's...
No, no! That whole thing!
... Whew! I'm glad that's over with.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Ayegor! Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Yes, Master!
Act casual!
How's it going?
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
Where is he?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
All right  where is she?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Bring  me  the  violin!
Can you play it?
Maybe...if you get here on time.
Thanks...for all your help.
That's what we're paid for.
I'm a failure.
Come on, Froderick  none of that.
What monster?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
What???
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
No! The only hope now is to get him back here. If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
That sound good, boss.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I like your style, master. How do we get him here?
There's only one way.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Come on, big fellow!
Is everything ready?
Yes, master. Are you sure you want to go through with it?
It's the only way.
Okay, boss! But I hope you know what you're doing.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
I beg your pardon?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Oh! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
That's true! But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science. Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Very good! Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it. Are there any more questions before we leave?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Yes?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
A piece of what?
Vermicelli.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the reanimation of component parts?
My father was a sick man.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen, sir.
Nineteen! My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But, sir...
I am a scientist...! not a philosopher.
You have more chance of reanimating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
But your grandfather's work, sir...
My grandfather's work was DooDoo! Dead is Dead! There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
Dr. Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Oh, at least, sir. The land alone is worth a small fortune.
But I can't just drop everything and leave. I have responsibilities and obligations.
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
How long will this whole thing take?
A week. Ten days at most.
I'll have to think it over. It's not so easy just to pick up and...
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
Why did you do that?
What?
Break that old man's violin.
I didn't do that.
The old violinist  you smashed his violin over your knee.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much. You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Yes, sir.
One week at the most!?
One week  I'll see to it, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Not at all  a great privilege, Doctor.
Saturday night then! I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Saturday night, yes, sir. Have a pleasant journey!
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
It seems fine.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring. I'll leave it on the table here.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
You mean... the laboratory??
Yes!... the laboratory.
No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
May I have it, please?
There seem to be quite a few books.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see. And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
well, there was a public and a private library  he said so in his will. these books are all very general  any doctor might have them in his study.
This is the only library I know of.
Surely he kept his notes  his private papers and records in some other place?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Well... we'll see.
Will there be anything else?
I don't think so. Is my assistant taken care of?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Good.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Elizabeth!?! 'Can't waits any longer. Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God! Not tonight.
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes.
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Yes.
Promise??
I promise.
Oh, darling  I'll count the hours that you're away.
Oh, darling  so will I.
Will you miss me?
Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Oh, nice.
I hope you like large weddings.
Whatever makes you happy.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
You're incorrigible!
Does that mean you love me?
You bet your boots it does.
I will! Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Darling!
Darling!
Surprised?
Surprised!
Love me?
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Darling!?!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am. Oh! These are my assistants: Inga and Ayegor.
Ready, darling?
Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
No, of course not. I just meant...
All right then!
Poor Delbruck! There must be some way to reach him  to control that body.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
But there's a genius inside that body  crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships. I just have to find some way to reestablish his communications system.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could  it would cost a fortune. Come to bed, darling.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you  you need rest.
I suppose you're right.
Of course I am. Now come along like a good boy.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Oh, darling! Don't let's spoil everything.
I don't want to spoil anything  I just want to top it all off.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
That's a tough choice.
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.
Of course I am. Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Good night.
That's my good boy.
Darling!
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
Miss me?
I...
What in God's name are you doing?
Baack!
What?
Baack!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MMMmmmm.
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMMmm!
Is it that music?
MMMMM! MMMMM!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts. the other one is just for socks and poopoo undies.
MMmmm.
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
MMmmm.
Herr Falkstein! Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
I did, sir.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Yes, sir.
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
Where did you get this cauliflower?
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
No, sir. It will never happen again.
Here! This cauliflower is useless to me.
Give him an extra dollar.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
He has a big mouth. Yes! It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student. But you have to remember that a worm  with very few exceptions  is not a human being.
Carlson!
Yes, sir?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir. Do you want the other cauliflower?
... No!
Frederick Frankenstein?
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
Victor Frankenstein.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron. But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle. These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears. How say you?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the Godfearing people of this village. What say you to that?
Poppycock!
I think we all need a good night's sleep. Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Now wait a minute!
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman  excuse me for interrupting. But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Yes, my dear, he is.
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Oh, shit.
Herr Falkstein  you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance. The estate will provide for your journey.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
The two in Alaska. Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time? Still tinkering with Cerebro?
What do you want with him?
Is that so?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind. Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves  definitively.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes. Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake... Leave him to me.
If I could make you understand. If you could just be made to see it the way I do. The way it's going to be.
The way what is going to be?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles. And this one gets a front row seat.
What do you mean to do?
This checkmate goes to you. I didn't want to hurt anyone. But you leave me no choice.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know. I just needed...
I know.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night? The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law  or one just like it  and they will come for you and your children? Take you all away?
It does indeed, Max.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
I lost him.
How?
It was Xavier's people. They knew.
Is that what you're looking for?
A piece. Only a piece.
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
I'll find him.
ALIVE.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
The sun is setting, Logan. You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
She borrowed your power to save her life. When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths  their gifts. In your case  your ability to heal. That's why she keeps her body covered.
I felt like she almost killed me.
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
What am I doing here?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Who?
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Fortyeight hours, old man. But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
Deal.
The point of what?
This. This whole God damn thing. Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of superpowered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature. For what?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility. To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
What if it never happens? What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy?  This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
Now that's Magneto talking.
No. That's me talking. And you know what? It's only been thirtytwo hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
Where are we going?
To find Rogue.
How?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
You designed this yourself?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?
We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I'll go.
Don't you knock?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
Why? You have a home here now, if you want it. Everyone will...
What?... miss me? Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
I do love a good check mate.
What do you want?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
You think I care about her? I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
Where am I?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
What are you going to do?
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan. We are the future... not them. We must protect ourselves. After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home  They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs. This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You mutant bastards...
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right. Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
Gosh, I hope so.
The intention of registration act 
INTENTION? Intention, Senator? We are talking about mankind here. His fear. It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps. Studied for weaknesses. And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
What is it you intend to do to me?
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator. The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Ms. Grey  you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York. Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
Math. History. Science. English. Athletics 
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to 
Control, Senator... we teach them control.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey. A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him. I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off. You do it the old fashioned way  you give 'em the finger. But what you presume to tell this committee 
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Dr. Grey.
Senator?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you think. Not all of us.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Anything else I can get you?
Some cigars. Case of beer.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I won't light the cigars  how about that?
I'll see what I can do  You should get some sleep. Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
What if I like the pain?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
Yeah? Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
You should always work with a spotter.
He's busy right now.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Were you now?
What do you say?
Not interested.
Let go.
Suit yourself.
He's uptight.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
Logan, do you see this ring?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
Inspiring  Now what am I doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
How long have you been in Alaska?
I don't remember. Is that what you wanted to ask me?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical. Systematic  Naive. You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
You know, you 
Shut up. I got no interest in you, Xavier, or your... XMen.
I'm o.k. I'm o.k.
Sure you are, sport.
Scott.. I 
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
You saw what happened tonight. You think Magneto won't come after him again. You think he won't come here if necessary. This is a school, for God's sake.
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
What's wrong with him?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
He's already losing control of his vitals. Respiratory. Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
We have to find Magneto.
Are you all right?
No. I'm... I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Hey. I'm sorry. About Logan. I was jealous.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
What's that?
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelonsized hole through him.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out. All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge. I'm taking her down.
Into the Hudson?
Uhhuh.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission. Jean, can you raise me up there?
It's too far.
Storm, Rogue,  you take the south entrance. Jean and I will go in here.
Jean... can you?
I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself  And without the neuro filter... there's no Cerebro.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Its core?
Correct... Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces. He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator. And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
For what purpose?
Yes  Only there's a problem. The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature. It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to. The Senator's body is literally burning itself out. Scott  this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
What does that mean?
The neurofilter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind. It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb. He had the energy source. He had the vacuum. But he didn't have the filament. He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
... until he found tungsten.
I wish I could go.
We all do.
Storm. Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island. It is my feeling that Magneto has to
Beast.
That's the guy.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
When else are you gonna do it?
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
Of course.
What's this?
This is a gift. From me to you.
What's going on, my friend?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Had to do what I had to do.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
What's "Anarchy 99"?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You wanna see my politics?
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
You got a great setup here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
That was for Anders.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of 
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
What's so damn funny?
Been to any good diners lately?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Help me with this guy.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Sit down.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Here we go again.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Nice hops.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Dude, what are you doing here?
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Is this what you're looking for?
Sorry, "dude".
What's the deal?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Why you dogging me up?
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I'm through, Xander.
I can see that. Why?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
Alright, so I'll get more.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
What...?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
You're serious?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
That's would be me.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brownnose the right people.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
They come in any other styles or colors?
This is your standard dart gun.
That one I'm real familiar with.
I think I'll hang on to these.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You're joking, right?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I thought that was in detail.
Nothing. He had two days.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
What are you doing?
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
What was that for?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Viktor! Stay the course.
The Peace conference...
Nice place to start, don't you think?
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Mind your business.
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Where are you going?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I was invited. What's your story?
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
That right? Why's that?
Who are you?
We hung out last night, remember?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Hey, you're good.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Go to hell!
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
What are you?
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
I'm from L.A.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
They tell me you're an American agent.
What are you talking about?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
What's that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
When can I see you again?
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
Are you alright?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Where are we going?
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't you afraid?
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
You don't have to do that.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me. I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Did you do your homework?
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Let's do this.
Where's he headed?
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
Go to the water, it's that way!
Toadies right behind.
Let me.
You okay?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
You can't talk to it?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
What are you doing?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
What game is that?
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Naturally.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
Yorgi masterminded the takeover of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro trash.
What weapons do you have?
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
What do you get if you finish?
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Like what?
He gets to be the hero.
Whatchu doing here?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
We're antisocial. We don't have any friends.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
What do you have?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
How will you fix it?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
That's exactly why we need them.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play. I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
So the odds are up to fiftyfifty? I can deal with that.
Who the hell are you?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yoyo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Why is that?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Is that a fact?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
What do I get out of it?
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hopalong.
Not bad for a gimp.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? LoJack?
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Yeah, I spy or I die.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Up yours.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Is that all?
Just remember, I'll be watching.
I guess you got my Email. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
Thanks.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Yes it does.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Who says you're the good guys?
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
You're a jerkoff, you know that?
New information.
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone. Comedian  Dr. Manhattan. All linked up.
What is that ungodly smell?
Bigger than I thought. CTU involved . . .
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories. Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there. I want you out. Now. And whatever you're doing, knock it off. You're making us all look bad.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian. Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Gila Flats  place where Jon turned into . . .
Dr. Manhattan, right. Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Veidt. You're the one who started World War III.
No. I just hastened the inevitable. He's been ready to blow for years. I knew all it would take was a little push. So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
You're making a big 
Terrorist. Radical agitator. Stool pigeon.
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!!  How'd you find me?
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff. I got nothing to do with 
Worked both sides of the fence. Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
CTU? Jesus. You don't think 
Don't know. Ask around. I'll be back.
Two things I hate. Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
No, no. You got it all wrong. I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Adrian.
Laurie! Good to see you.
Don't rub it in. I live here.
And how's life with the walking Hbomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  Let me take your coat.
Adrian! Don't leave so soon. I 
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Please.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Stay, Adrian. I just  every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human. He doesn't think like we do. He doesn't even feel what we feel. I mean  he even scares the research teams.
Laurie  he's the most powerful man who's ever lived. He's changed the world.
I know. I shouldn't be saying this. He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work 
What about you?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I. I'll ring for the guards.
Nasty cough.  Try one of mine. Darling, you need to get out of the house. Why don't you give Daniel a call? I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Maybe I'll do that.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Their real names, please.
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
You're not "protecting" anyone. These people's lives may depend on the answers you give. These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan 
Then why don't you ask him?!?
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk. As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan. They have something else in common as well. They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
What are you saying? That Jon is radioactive?
I'm terribly sorry.
What does this mean? What does it 
Six to eight months. That's with treatment.  Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
That's it. This is all a trick, isn't it? Some kind of horrible joke to make me 
All right, Miss Juspeczyk. Pack your things.
Am I free to go?
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please. Let's move it.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit 
Oh, I am, honey. You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute. And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit  because our numberone strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Jon?? You mean he's 
That's right. Your meal ticket's flown the coop. That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Sphinx brand. When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area. I was thinking: what would do some good in the world? And I thought: why not a geneticallyaltered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer  but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it? In fact I think I'll have one now. Care to join me?
Thanks, no. But it's a wonderful product. Now Adrian  your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors 
No. No. Cut.  Justine, we agreed. No questions about the Watchmen.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
No. We laid out very careful ground rules 
No comment.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I did not. Now get out of my way!
Isn't it true that you 
I'll say. If we ever get off this looneytune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
With lots of ketchup?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy. What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Anything for science, I guess. Janey, there's something 
We should get back  What?
Nothing. What were you going to say?
We should get back to the lab. You okay, Jon?
Stupid watch. Stopped again. Do you have the 
Janey, will you marry me?
I can fix it.
 What?
My dad's a watchmaker. I'll put it back together for you. Better than ever.
Hiya, pardner. Long time no see.
Did anybody follow you? See you come here?
Sure. You got some kind of  bean juice on it.
Human bean juice. The Comedian is dead.
So do I. So do you.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago. I mean, that  that's just paranoia.
Maybe. Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us. Somebody with a grudge. Thought you might want to spread the word.
Hey. Hey. If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
. . . That was quick.
Toilet clogged. Short fat turd. Let's get out of here.
I don't know if you heard. A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Veidt's a fool. Tried to warn him about new information. Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What new information?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU. Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . .
CTU. Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frameup.
What do you mean, frameup?
Obvious pattern  all ties in 
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us? What about all those poor shits with cancer?
How do we know they've got cancer? Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Come on, Rorschach. Gimme a break 
Where's Laurie?
I don't think she's coming with us.
We're running, Rorschach. We've got no place to go. We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Veidt's assassin. Leads to follow. Can't just 
Cases, leads  they don't matter, Rorschach. The world's about to end. If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Coward. Giving up.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Sorry, Daniel. You've always been a good friend. I know that. Sorry about Laurie.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
What happened?
The guidance system's fried. I had to switch to manual.  Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What caused it?
Don't know. Nothing I can think of   outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian. What are you doing? Why wouldn't you let us in?
He's the one. He's been the one all along. Stalking us.
Adrian  you? You killed Blake, and 
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian. Its too late. The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake. I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us  do you?
Dan, are you really that paranoid? Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Psychotic pig. He had it coming. Mr. CTU . . .
Now wait. We all had the same option as Blake. It was work for the government or do time.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit? It's a fucking Gestapo! Dirty tricks  political assassinations 
Okay, okay. You made your choice. You went underground. Some of us made other choices.
DREIBERG +++$+++
Damn straight.
Damn straight! We were heroes.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Well, that was Adrian's idea. I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but  talk about publicity hounds . . .
Hey. You remember that nut in the hockey mask? With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Oh yeah. The one that used to confess to everything? Hoping we'd beat him up?
That's the one. Whatever happened to him?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing. Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . . How about you, Laurie?
Oh, yeah. They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. No expense account. No place to live.
You'll find something.  I should go. You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
They're not following me, Dan. I mean  Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III. Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Dan, what are you so scared of? I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel  I feel glad. I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and 
Laurie, wait. I've got a spare room. It's empty. If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't. You'd just be all nervous about 
No, screw that. What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  I'd love to have you stay.
You're sure?
Oh. No. Sorry. I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or 
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  You've been really sweet. Sleep tight, okay?
His what?
His . . . whatever.
I'm not his . . . whatever. Okay?
I told you I was a little bit out of step. A lot of the old stuff I listen to  it never came out on crystal.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago. Nellie Lutcher  Louis Jordan  I've never even heard of these people.
Play one. Educate yourself.
No wonder Adrian's rich. You use that stuff?
Sure. It works. I mean, look at this face, Daniel. I'm thirtyeight years old!
I don't mind getting older. I'm obsolete anyway. Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look. It's strange with Jon. He doesn't age. His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Old?
Not at all. You look very  dashing. Here, you pick one.
. . . What?
Pick a record. I feel like dancing.
Eight cops? Oh, great. A jury's gonna love that.
Are you kidding? If they put him in jail he's dead. He'll never get to trial.
I just realized. I'd never seen his face. I guess it was just a matter of time. He's totally  Daniel? What's wrong?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Ohh. I could use some dinner. Who was that on the phone?
One more down. Someone tried to kill Adrian. . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
 What is it.
I know what you're thinking. You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Laurie 
I'm an open target, Dan. If you're with me 
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Enough is enough, Daniel. Where exactly are we?
Memory lane.
The Owlship. I can't believe it.
 I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
I took her out a couple of summers back. Scared the hell out of some cows.  I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Antarctica??
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat. He invited us to come along. I've been thinking. If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Would you want to sit out a war? I mean  what would be left.
You and me.
Dan! The spare costumes! I can't believe you kept them.
Me neither. Mine barely even fits. The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't. Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know. It all seems so abstract.
God, you sound like Jon.  Turn around.
What are you up to?
Don't look. Turn around.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
Okay!
What the hell  ?
It's a peace rally. The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Oh, Laurie. Jesus. No.
They're following us.
All right. Mission accomplished.
Missed 'em Dan. You're aiming high!
I don't want to take 'em out. Just want to keep 'em interested.
They're practically on us . . .
That Detroit shit? I'm so worried.
What?
The costumes. Am I right?
No way. I'm not that much of a pervert.
Yes you are.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on. Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
That's because 
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. The world's about to end. I feel like I could save it.
You're full of yourself. What are you doing?
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . . I miss Rorschach. Let's spring him.
. . . What??
What's he doing?
I think he's going to the john.
My God! We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a 
I beg your pardon . . . ? Some gratitude.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What now? Fly south  hook up with Adrian?
What was he doing?
Trying to change the past. He said it was the only way to save the world 
He saved himself. He changed the past.
Where did he go?
Dan, is this  is this New York??
Those cars. What year is this??
Everything's changed 
Dan  what do we do now?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left. Backs together 
We'll tell them what's happened. They'll listen to reason, won't they  ?
The Comedian. He's dead. Murdered. That's all I know.
My God. Murdered?  What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's  he's got some kind of conspiracy theory. He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Us. You mean the Watchmen.
I know, I know, it's just  he's back on the street, he smells blood.
You know how he is. He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs  then he's satisfied. It blows over.
He's bound to get caught. I don't want my name coming out. Not at this late date.
If he comes here, I'll handle him. Remember  I've always protected you. Haven't I? Do you need money?
No. I just wanted you to 
You did the right thing, Daniel. Let's stay in touch, okay? Good night.
Good night.
Who?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right. Is Laurie okay?
She's with me.
Good. Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard. Look, I'm going to head south for a while  hole up at Karnak until all this blows over. You two would be welcome to join me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian. I'll let you know.
Yeah. See, I've been working on a little project. Top secret, of course . . .
The missing scientists.
Uh huh. You might recognize the names. Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
What??
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
It is Jon. Twentyfour years ago. Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Good Lord. How'd you get it on tape?
It's not on tape. It's live. We're watching it happen.
Gentlemen, the past. Unfolding before your eyes. Stand back from the field. It'll blow you to bits.
What is it? How does it work?
It's a tachyon chamber. It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time. There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines  existing parallel to our own 
Adrian  you've lost it.
I've seen them! I've seen them in there.
Dont be obtuse, Daniel. If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen. We wont even be here, will we?
And what if youre wrong?
Im not.
What if youre wrong??
Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me. Christ! Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision. You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it. As if any of it mattered.
You ruthless son of a bitch. You really believe this madscientist bullshit is going to save the world?
We'd better hope so.  It's almost time.
Blake? Dead?
Yes. I heard this morning. Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
I'm here, Laurie.
Is it time? D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Would you like me to stay?
Mm hmm.
I could stay and go.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
I'm not here. I'm still on Mars. I've come to collect you.
Collect me?
In the immediate future we're on Mars. I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Jon, no  I can't 
It will happen, Laurie. I've already seen it. Neither of us can do anything to change it.
The atmosphere. I'm sorry. These things slip my mind.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to  where are we 
This whole place is ticking. Does it  keep time?
Yes. In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
You  you know about me and Dan?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about? Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me. When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a  a collection of atoms.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Well, I just, you just said  don't act surprised.
That's how time works, Laurie. Everything is preordained . . . even my responses. We're all puppets. I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  Thirty seconds.
Jon  there's something I have to know. Did you love me once?
Yes, I loved you. I left the earth when I lost you.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer. Just be being with me.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie. Not you, not the others. I don't know what did.
But you knew that I'd  die.
Memories of the future are just like any others. I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . You won't die of cancer, Laurie. There won't be time for that.
Then it's going to happen. The world's going to end.  And you've always known.
Always. Ever since the day I died.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Because 
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained. So sorry. I forgot. Jon. This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I don't know yet. I should be able to tell you in  roughly six hundred years.
I can't stand any more of this. I want to go back. If I'm going to die I want to be with  other people.
Please, Laurie. Not yet. I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore. I'll be alone. You're the last human being I'll ever see.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I'm sorry. Look  there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Oh God. I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
You're the only human being I care for.
Then do me a favor. If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit. I want you to cure me.
I won't do that.
You have the power to do it. I want you to do it. Please.
I explained this. I can't. That's not the way it happens.
Jon. If you ever loved me  if there's anything human left in you  then do it.
What  am I 
Cured, yes.
Its very strange. Times flowing backwards . . .
Jon  what??
The south pole. Times flowing backwards.
Jon, where are we?
Veidts complex.
Jon 
Space and time. I finally understand, Laurie. I see it all now.
Jon  for Gods sake, what do you see?
I see what the watchmaker made. I see the universe!
Hi, Jon.
Hello, Adrian.
The bearer of bad news.
We've lost a colleague. The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach's on the case. He's got Dreiberg in a lather. He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
Oh? The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts. They don't concern me.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
You mean Afghanistan? It won't require my attention. What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Jon! Get back! You don't understand.
Walter 
Don't call me that.
Walter  you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Wrong answers?
There's no right or wrong. But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you. I want to help you. I want to know all about you.
Hnnrr.  Like to masturbate. Shit once a day.
A whore fucking.
Who is she? Do you know her?
And what  split  the dog's skull open?
Why, doctor. I did. He was a bad dog.
Walter. This compulsion of yours  to punish transgressors. In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
God isn't there to do it.
We don't know that.
That man, then, he was the first. The first you 
Saw the world that night  random, empty, hideous. God didn't make it that way. We did. We make the world  in our own image. What else can I illuminate?
Had a lot of blood in him.
You oughta see upstairs. It's a slaughterhouse.
No idea who's behind this?
Small army, from the looks of it. He put up one hell of a fight.
He would  You might as well know. It's gonna get messy. We got a call from Washington.
Washington?
They want in. Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
What about our end?
Well, sir . . . in a worstcase scenario . . . we'd assume that twentyfive percent of the Russian birds get through.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Thirty minutes maximum. Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a goodsized chunk of the farm belt.
What about the aftermath? This socalled . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
The weather. I see. Keep me posted. I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Why? What's the problem?
I can't tell you that. It is quite urgent.
I would like to use the bathroom 
The access code's been changed. Your card won't work anymore.
What?!
Please.
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate. Cocksure.
And expensive. Cost three million plus.
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
Anywhere in this circle. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Marvellous.
The parcels in the post.
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Where it can do the most damage.
Any word from him?
Still no contact yet.
Warm.
Is it?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
How would you know?
Why are you like this? Because Bond is dead? Its what you wanted.
Of course...
He was a...good lover?
What do you think?
This is the end.
No. It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Everythings under control up here. Are you ready?
Yes. Au revoir...
Ill send someone out.
Could...could you come?
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Please.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Your father...
Is nothing. His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Now you know how it feels. To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Someone will come.
Who? Bond? Bond is dead.
What?
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
No! Bond!
Bond!
What is this place?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Cclass.
Valentin Zukovsky.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
You, of course. I need some information.
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world. A nice little rats nest.
Have some of the rats nest caviar. From my own fishery. They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
See? Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with stateoftheart Russian Army weapons?
What? This is not possible.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Where did you get this?
Off a highpowered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Shes no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see. A purely...plutonic relationship.
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Whats your business with Elektra King?
I thought you were the one in her business.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House  your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
You are out of your league. Shes working with Renard.
Now...where were we?
A rope!
No. The truth! She thought I was dead  those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for?
Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff.
And the payoff on the tables?
A special job. A...a...a submarine.
Wheres the sub going?!
No! Get me out!
This is too big for even you. Where is it?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
So. My way. No MI6, no Interpol. Just you, me and my people.
Where?
Istanbul.
Mother of God.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot  it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
The Maidens Tower.
How appropriate.
Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
Yes.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Funerals arent exactly memorable.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father. I loved him. Im not sure he knew that.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Partially, yes.
Who is he?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette.
How long has he been with you?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Does this look familiar to you?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
Thats every man within a five mile radius. Including you. Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I have to check the upper lines. Gabor will drive you back.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
No.
Oh my God...were buried alive...
Were alright.
I cant stay here.
Youre not going to.
No! It will cave in!
Its the only way out...
I cant stay.
I know.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
What is it?
...you should rest.
James...
I have to go.
Then take me with you.
No. Youll be safe here.
I dont want to be safe!
I have to go to work.
Vodka martini.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye. What are you doing here? Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Really?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
You knew when you first saw me. You knew it would be like this.
Shush.
How did you survive?
I used my body on the guards. It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance. Ive never told anyone that.
Whats wrong with you? Are you crazy?
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive? Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
What are you talking about?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
...what?
We had a runin, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, its over.
I dont know what youre talking about!
I think you do.
How dare you! How dare you! That animal!? That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me! So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
He used your exact words.
You knew. You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me  what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Im coming with you.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M. Shes en route from London even now.
I could have given you the world.
Not interested.
Wheres M?
Soon shell be everywhere.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
You turned Renard.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
So you killed your father.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Was this all about the oil?
It is my oil! Mine and my familys!
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
Noone will believe this meltdown was an accident.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
Elektra, its not too late. Eight million people neednt die.
One... last... screw?
Oh James.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Yes.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
You knew him well?
He was my father.
Im sorry.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream. I intend to finish it for him.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Indeed.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Who is it?
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no? Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Consider me ungrateful.
Its I who should thank you  for taking that money back to MI6. So distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair.
Shell get over it.
You even brought the plane for us. We really couldnt have done it without you.
In case youve forgotten. Im dead already.
Havent you heard the news? So is she.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Which is neutral, no doubt.
I did not get the report from an MI6 agent.
Who did you get it from?
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
The name?
I cant tell you... Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Constructions not exactly my line.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Old friend?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Elektra? Running King Industries? Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Shes not a girl anymore.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oilrich. Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
I took the initiative.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Its a message. He wants us to know hes back.
Who?
Claude Serrault. A.K.A...
Renard.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me. I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
He survived?
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the xrays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline. And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The worm on the hook again.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
The inside man?
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Dislocated collar bone. If any more tendons snap... It wont just be two weeks out of action.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Its just a scratch.
James. It wouldnt really be...
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
I could come for a second opinion?
You new?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Dont know any doctor jokes.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
He is an impostor. Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside. Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
So who are you?
Bond 
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card. A Miratom device. Emits a highpitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
With this?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Alright then, brunch.
The plutonium is missing. Theyve taken the core!
Then its no longer a bomb?
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
What the hell were you doing? You nearly killed us!
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
What the hell are you talking about?
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Whos she?
Elektra King.
Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her pipeline.
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
What is it?
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now. And Ms life is part of the bet.
Nuclear.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor. Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Made to look just like an accident.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
The King pipeline.
Elektra would control it all.
Zukovsky...
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
Is there another way?
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Hes sealed himself in.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Do you know what youre doing?
Like riding a bike.
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty. When you get to twenty open the hatch. It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
But what if...
Count to twenty. Ill be there.
Weve got to get out.
We cant.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a  a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
But I still want one.
Yes  ....
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Oh! Help me! The balloon's going up!
 Ruined my exit!
Help!
Uh  now, please don't be angry with me. I'll  I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
It makes you nervous?
Yes.
What about us?
Well, I 
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man ?
Well, I 
 And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Well, I 
Well 
You promised us real things  a real...
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
Th.D.?
How can I ever thank you enough?
Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend  you're a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes. Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city. And they have no more courage than you have. But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal! Therefore  for meritorious....
Beautiful! What an echo!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not. Beehive  bah! Let her try and make a beehive out of me! You know  Hmm? What's that?
No, sir!
No, sir!
That's right.
We do.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Animals that  that eat straw?
Some  but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be gentle as a lizard 
I'd be clever as a gizzard 
Then I'm sure to get a brain 
A heart 
Come on  come on 
Hurry  hurry 
Oh! Oh, come on, come on!
Look  you can see it here. It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
Hey, Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Oh  oh, poor Dorothy!
Don't cry  you'll rust yourself again!
Oh! We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Yes.
Oh  now look at him! This is terrible!
Here, Tin Man  help me.
Oh, this is terrible  can't budge her an inch! This is a spell, this is!
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! HELP!
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you! Help!
Ha  ha  ha 
Ho  ho ho
Did you hear that? He'll announce us at once! I've as good as got my brain!
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Oh, did  did you see that?
Oh  look out.
You know something?
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis.
It's a whozis?
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh! Well, what happened to you?
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Well, that's you all over.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing  to go to pieces at a time like this!
Now, now, don't fret.
Oh, dear, dear.
We'll get you together!
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
...to Dorothy!
Oh 
Come on, fellows!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there. We've got to get her out.
Don't cry now. We haven't got the oilcan with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
No, you don't.
Oh, no!
Whew! That wasn't my plan  but something happened, didn't it?
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Yeah 
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Oh  upstairs, quickly!
Go on!
Hey  what about Dorothy?
Yes  how about Dorothy?
...Tin Man!
Ohhhh  it's me!
...junk!
Ohhhh  yes...yes, sir  YYes, your Honor. You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and 
Quiet!
Ohhhhhh!
...of the West.
BBBBBBut if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Mr. Gale!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
I want to see you and your wife right away....
... about Dorothy.
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
You mean she bit you?
No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
NO!
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why!
Here  here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Oh, scared, huh?
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good  I'm afraid of 'em.
Dorothy!
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Not even a rhinoceros?
Imposserous!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
She  she can have my Witch Remover.
What's that? What's that? Take it away  take it away  Take it away!
Hold still  hold still 
It's a whatzis.
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Whozat?
Now, let' s see  this goes  Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Yeah 
...I  I  I hope my strength holds out.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh 
No? Now, wait a minute.
You don't neither 
Where do we go now?
Yeah.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Don't push!
You don't get around us that easy!
Not nohow!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Don't you start it, too!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Who at?
I don't know.
Wait a minute, fellahs. I was just thinkin'. I really don't want to see the Wizard this much. I better wait for you outside.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I  Oh 
Here  Come on.
What was that?
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
Don't stand there talking! Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Fine. He's got a plan
And you're going to lead us.
Yeah. Me?
Yes, you.
I  I  I  I  gotta get her outta there?
That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy  Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch  guards or no guards  I'll tear 'em apart. I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there. There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Up!
Now...
Come on  I've got another idea.
Do  do you think it'll be polite  dropping in like this?
Stop pushing!
Oh  I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Where  where do we go now?
This way! Come on!
You humbug!
Yeah!
Real courage. That's what we want.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Yeah.
Ah 
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy  ah  Dor 
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company  until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
It did?
Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Leave her alone!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
...ting the ruby slippers?
The slippers  yes.....the slippers!
The ruby slippers! What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll 
It's too late! There they....
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Very well  I'll bide my time  and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
...don't talk.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Down? No, you see, I'm  Well,  I'm 
Oh, well, here  let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you  very kind.
...yes.
Ohhhh 
Ohh!
Whhhooops! Haha  there goes some of me again!
Oh  does it hurt you?
Oh, no  I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Ohhh 
My, it's good to be....
...free!
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
No, No  I  I just thought you hurt yourself.
Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
They would?
Umhmm.
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
You're going to see a Wizard?
Umhmm.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Yes  that's true.
But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything  except a lighted match.
I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look  I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing  and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh  well  you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
To Oz?
To Oz!
Oh, dear  I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Come along, Dorothy  you don't want any of those apples. Hmm!
Hooray! I guess that did it! Help yourself.
Oh 
Why, it's a man! A man made out of tin!
What?
Yes. Oh  look 
Oil can what?
Oil can? Oh  oh, here it is!
He said his mouth.
Here  here 
The other side....
Yes  there.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
And I'll keep the oilcan handy.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had! And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time. But I couldn't have, could I?
I don't see how. You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't like this forest! It's  it's dark and creepy!
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do  do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
...along.
Oh, no  please. I have to rest for just a minute. Toto!
It does help. Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh 
Yes  there 
Oh  here quick  oh!  we'll oil him up.
 A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been 
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Oh 
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh  and I was so happy! I thought I was on my way home!
Oh  Oh 
Oh  are you  are you all right?
Oh, come on now  everybody 
Did you just hear what I just heard?
No  No  No  No!
Ohh! OHH! OHH!
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! Help! Help! Help!
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't have any brains at all.
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Why, Zeke,  you're just as scared as I am!
What's the matter  gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
What  what did you do that for? I didn't bite him.
No, but you tried to.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs 
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding?
Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are  Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
You're right  I am a coward.
...has been simply unbearable.
Oh.
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess  Be a lion not a mouess  If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dandelion  A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard 
A home 
The nerve.
It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be. He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Well, come on, then. What are we waiting for?
Yes  let's run!
Yes.
Oh  unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Look! He's rusted again. Oh, give me the oil can  quick! Ohoh, quick!
Ho  ho ho  ho
Hah!
Who's her? Who's her?
It's the Witch! She's followed us here!
Oh, but  but please. It's very important.
And  and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
I'll be home in time for supper!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King! If....
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Not nobody, not nohow!
How about a hippopotamus?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh, well, then  we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
But why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Oh  Oh, come on.
Huh? What'd he say?
Does it work?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Oh 
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I'd like to roar 'em down  But I think I lost my roarer.
Oh  Oh  Oh! Toto  Toto!
Did they hurtcha?
Lion, darling  I knew you'd come!
They're coming back!
Ohhh!
...Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!
Oh  oh  they're all wonderful.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go.
Oh, that's very kind of you  but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Well  I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Oil can.....Oil can....
Did you say something?
Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?
My mouth  my mouth!
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness  I can talk again! Oh  oil my arms, please  oil my elbows.
Oh...
Oh 
...Oh, did that hurt?
No  it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh 
Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
Oh  well, about a year ago  I was chopping that tree  minding my own business  when suddenly it started to rain....
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid. And I've been that way ever since.
Well, you're perfect now.
My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect? Oh  bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead  bang on it!
Oh !
Oh 
All hollow. Oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear  That was wonderful! You know  we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.
Ohh  what's that? Oh 
Oh! They're  they're gone now.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I  I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept  Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh  I'll get it!
Oh! Oh!
Oh 
Oh, see  I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Ohoh
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember. But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we?
We might.
Oh 
And bears!
What sort of an animal is that?
Itititit  it's a huge one!
And him a brain.
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh 
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
No. Why only  Oh 
Oh! Oh, Tin Man! Oh!
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Now come on  you're acting silly 
Dorothy!
I knew you would!
Tomorrow? Oh, but I want to go home now.
You've had plenty of time already!
Ahh  Oh, it ticks! Listen!
Yes...!
...yes.
Look  it ticks!
Now I know I've got a heart  'cause it's breaking.
Oh  Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
That dog's a menace to the community. I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?
Now you're seeing reason.
No 
Here's what I'm taking him in  so he can't attack me again.
Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Here! I've got an order! Let me have...
Stop her!
Let's see  you're  you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right. I  you're  you're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong. That's...You're  running away.
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses  he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why 
No, no  now don't tell me. They  they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands  big cities  big mountains  big oceans 
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Yes 
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, yes  you  you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh 
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Aw, come, come, come 
No, they won't  honestly.
Oh 
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing  Yes, well, I  I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
That's our farm!
Oh  yes.
...her face is careworn.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her  her name is Emily.
That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I  I can't quite see. Why, she's crying.
Oh 
Someone has hurt her  someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
I had the measles once  and she stayed right by me every minute.
Uhhuh.
What's she doing now?
...room 
Has it poppies on the wall....
...paper?
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh  she's  What's this? Why, she's  she's putting her hand on her heart  she's  she's dropping down on the....
...bed.
Oh, no  no!
That's all  the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh, you....
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh  Oh, I've got to go home right away!
But  what's this? I thought you were going along with me.
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Oh 
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Oh! Well....
Toto's my dog.
Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh. But, if you please  what are Munchkins?
The little people who live in this land  it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right  you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now  you may all come out.
I thought you said she was dead.
That was her sister  the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West. And she's worse than the other one was.
Pooh  what a smell of sulphur! I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether  but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came.
No  that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
It's always best to start at the beginning  and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Oh, will you help me? Can you help me?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
I have?
...Toto, too?
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear  that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's  it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here  here's your oilcan. Goodbye.
Are you ready now?
Yes. Say goodbye, Toto.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
And think to yourself  "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
...didn't you?
No  No! It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
What are you going to do with my dog? Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty  all in good time.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly  certainly  when you give me those slippers.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
No! No  no! Here  you can have your old slippers  but give me back Toto.
That's a good little girl. I knew you'd see reason.
Ahh! Ah!
I'm sorry. I didn't do it! Can I still have my dog?
No! Fool, that I am! I should have remembered  those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sourfaced old maid that  she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
This?
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan  that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents  Oh, stop it!
Oh!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Hickory!
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here! Help!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Yes, I'm all right. Oh  I fell in and  and Zeke 
Uhhhh  yes...
I don't believe you!
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Yesss  that...that's exactly so. I'm a humbug!
Oh ....
Frightened? You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death  sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified. Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Ohhh!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job,  retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway. And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Oh! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back!
I can't come back! I don't know how it works!
Oh 
Goodbye, folks!
Our echo.
Tap  tap  tap  tap  What was that  that  that? Our echo  echo  echo.
Oh, come on  come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
The Wizard  The Wizard  The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz  Oz  OzOz  Oz  Oz  Oz  Oz!
...have you come back?
Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her.
Oh ....
...resourceful!
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast! Not....
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Do you presume to criticize the....
...  Oz  has spoken!
Who are you?
Well, I  I  I am the Great and Powerful  Wizard of Oz.
You are?
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
To see?
If she...
If she?
Is morally, ethic'ly
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
From now on you'll be history
You'll be hist...
Look at you, Zeke  you're just as white 
Here, here, what's all this jabberwapping when there's work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Well, Dorothy was walking along the 
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and 
Well, don't start posing for it now. Here, here  can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock  you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Yes.
Uhh  yeah 
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Aunt Em!
Fiftyseven, fiftyeight 
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She 
Dorothy, please! We're trying to count! Fiftyeight
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the 
Seventy  Dorothy, please!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day  just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and 
Dorothy! Dorothy! We're busy!
Oh  all right.
Auntie Em, really  you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She said she was gonna 
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No 
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Dorothy!
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto! Don't let her take him  please!
 no place like home  there's no place like home  no place 
Dorothy. Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em  it's you!
Yes, darling.
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry  that's just the trouble. And I tried to get back for days and days.
There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream.
No 
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we 
No, Aunt Em  this was a real, truly live place. And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Is this where we're going?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Momma... are they angry with us.
No... No. It is just the English way.
I don't want to stay here.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
No, you listen. Get out!
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal. He's got a gun, hasn't he?
You have no right here!
He'll live.
You might have killed him!
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
Get back in there.
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
She say where he is?
I don't think she knows.
What about Carter?
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Lean on him.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
They don't have any shit.
He's not in this building.
All right, where is he?
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different. Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
Who was that man?
His name is John Book.
Is the English dead?
No...
Looks dead...
That has no place in this house.
I know.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli. But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eli, John is a carpenter. As well as being a fine policeman.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barnraising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I have committed no sin.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look... Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
That is idle talk.
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting! Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
I am not a child.
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
You shame yourself.
No, Rachel...
I have to help him!
Everything okay?
Yes, thank you very much.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
Oh.
Good morning.
You didn't have to...
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first. Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
What's so funny?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
God, Fred...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No? Why not?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that selfrighteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
Did you find him?
Not yet.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know anybody who knows John knows that's a goddamn lie!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
I don't know where he is.
But... if you had to guess?
You know where he is.
Wrong.
You'd lie to protect him.
Probably.
You admit you're lying?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton. Tell me what you know...
What I know, Paul, is... He's going to take you out...
Anybody know about this?
I didn't even know about it.
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
I got there late, John.
Let's just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
It won't happen again.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Listen to me Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
I hear you.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
It's me.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I'm coming.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
You hear me?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
That's more like it. Where are you at, anyway?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Say again?
Make that 1790.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
There'll be another train. The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
Where are you taking us?
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You have no right to keep us here.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
It's not a joke.
What was that?
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Now what's the problem?
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Whacking?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
We do not go into your courts.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
No you're not You're glad, because now you've got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They don't seem to like you very much.
They kid a lot.
I would not be too sure.
But not a good tired.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
No.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
Oh? Anything else?
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops. I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
But why would they murder...
Because somehow they knew I was getting close. Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything. And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Where are you taking us now?
Home.
You couldn't wait until morning?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
I was wrong.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
I can't.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
No, no doctor...
But why?
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
But 
Who are they?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Can I have something to drink?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
How long?
What?
How long have I been here?
Two days.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
But you can't.
Tell him his tea stinks.
You tell him. When you're able.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun 
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for. That is not for Samuel.
Enjoying your reading?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure. What's that?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Your husband's?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
I should tell you these do not have buttons. See? Hooks and eyes.
Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Anything against zippers?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
No. I'd want a public phone.
Well... the store at Saltzburg... But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
I'm going this morning.
But Stoltzfus said...
I know what he said.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
The... bullets?
Oh. The bullets.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Oh? What happened to Hochstetler?
We had some lemonade and he left.
A real fireball.
You know carpentry?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
What else can you do?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
Sure.
But... You may not be well enough.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
When will you be going?
Not long... A few days.
Won him over just like that.
I see. But I hope you have a lot of sugar. Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow.
I'm leaving tonight. I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
There was.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
I was being foolish?
No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
You're so sure of that?
Aren't you? After today?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough. Just as I could live yours!
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Where's my baggy pants?
Here. Whenever you want them.
How reliable is this kid?
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
What have you got?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
You know who?
Maybe.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde what'shername come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
What'shername moved to Buffalo.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy. I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut... It fits, Paul... Fiftyfive gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth fivegrand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fiftyfive gallon drum.
Who else knows?
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it. I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
What's your first move?
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Who else knows?
Just us.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
Johnny 
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
I've already got something worked out. Be seeing you.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
Don't try me, Johnny!
It's all over, Paul.
Move! Or you die right here!
I saw him.
Who'd you see?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
He was... like him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
No pistol. Ever.
Tell you what I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Okay, Mr. Book.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
You don't say.
Hey, Sam...
...I want to say a thing.
What's that, Sam?
Is it them?
It's them, Sam. Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Are they going to kill you?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
What are you going to do?
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Don't let them hurt you.
I won't. Now run. Fast as you can!
Are you really ever coming back?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Have you got your gun on now?
Sure have, Sam.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I thought I was the English.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler. You look plain, Book. Very plain.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Try the house.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
It's been a while.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Your hole is healed, then?
Pretty much.
Nail it!
Yes, sir.
Everything is all right, John.
Pick up the hat.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Sorry. It's important.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holierthan thou mouth shut! Anyway, they like Fred.
Oh sure, Fred.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
They're Amish.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
John, I don't understand any of this.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, why?...
Just do it!
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Maybe milking.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Not one this big.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Queen Cherlindrea?
She requests the presence of your self and the young princess.
Who??
You're the guardian, aren't you?
I'm getting her out of there!
No! You let us handle this. Come along, Rool!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Take your time. Don't worry about the elves. They won't come out here.
Why not?
This is not going well.
Hurry! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Talk! Say something!
I can't see anythingshe's too bright!
Hey, careful there!
How do these work I wonder? I got ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
How are we going to get out there?
We've traveled a long way. We're looking for Fin Raziel.
The sorceress.
Obviously.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen. We'd better go.
This can't be right. This isn't a sorceress. This is some kind of animal.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Shut up.
She needs to be changed.
I changed her already!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby. Soon the baby stops crying. Re lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Madmartigan.
Who is he?
I don't know much about him.
She's hungry.
I know she's hungry. I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing. I'm not a wet nurse.
Here. Hold her.
Elves! They're always tormenting babies. They make them cry and take their tears.
Somebody has to do it.
Watch this. Right between the eyes.
He never misses.
I'm not going in there.
Me neither!
Are you sure?
Yes! Raziel! She lives out on that island!
We gotta follow them.
Us?? We'll never catch them. Any way, we're all done, Teemo. Let's go home.
Get back here, Rool!
Ouch! Let go of me!
Who are you! Who are you!
I'm Willow Ufgood. I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
What do you want!
We need your help. To take this baby to Tir Asleen. She's a prin cess.
Kill him!
No!
Kill him!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
No.
A magician *makes* magic. Any fool can use it.
You must learn magic.
That's all I ever wanted!
Then I will teach you.
Willow. To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
What do I need for that?
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this?
Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you...
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
As below, so above. You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
I'm all finished. Now what?
Burn it to a fine ash.
How am I gonna do that?
Patience. Concentrate. You will find a way.
We don't have much time left! Go on! Go on!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
The limitless power of...
Your will! Your will! What else could it be?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
The art of transformation!
But what am I gonna transform??
Me!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
That's the life spark. Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Ouch!!
Shhhhh!
What'd you bit me for!!
We need blood. To nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener gy.
Again: what is the magician's weapon?
His will.
Now use it.
I just wanted to test it first.
No! Change me back into a sor ceress, Willow.
Tir Asleen.
There's nobody here.
How??
Use the philosopher's stone! Hur ry! Invocation! Release them!
I did it! Madmartigan! Come here! Look! You gotta see this! I did it!
More! More!
Raziel! I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them. That was noth ing. Now change me.
Get down! The ritual chant! Quick! Protect yourself!
Why?
Just do it!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Time is running out.
Surrender!!
Patience, Willow.
Courage, Willow.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby. It looks like a daikini...
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Absolutely not.
Dada, what's a daikini?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Are you scared?
I could be you rguard! I could carry your spear!
What a great son you are, Ranon. I wish I could take you with me. Now go to sleep...
Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Good. How long will it take?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
You be careful. I'm a powerful sorcerer. I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Miserable Pecks.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Why.
I have to give this baby to some body.
Hey! Somebody's coming!
Peck! Quick! Douse the fire!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
Are you okay?
As if you care. I saved your life, Peck. Those guys woulda killed us! You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
I don't know.
You a woodcutter?
Farmer.
Farmer! I knew it! You're a vic tim, Willow. Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor rupt, rotten world.
You all right?
These burns. My arms. Ouch...
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
What's that? I hear something!
You hear trouble.
What is it?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk! You slime! When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pigpole!
Friend of yours?
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
I hate this.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why? Nobody cares... Except me. You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
You don't know anything about ba bies.
You gotta promise to feed her.
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Absolutely!
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold. And keep her diaper changed.
Of course! I promise!
Here are her diaper rags. And this is her milk bladder. And when she criesshe's either hungry or she's tiredrock her on your left shoulder. She likes that.
Don't worry, Willow. She's in good hands. You haven't made a mistake.
You!!
Where the hell did you come from?
Hey! Give me that baby!
These Pecks make terrible nurse maids.
Nursemaid?!
Time to change her diaper.
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
I thought you had her!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
Elora Danan!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan! You saved her life!
I did?
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh? I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
Yes it does. The Fairy Queen told me.
The Fairy Queen? And the baby here's a princess? And these two rodents are your guides?
Madmartigan, I need your help.
My help? A great magician like you? You don't need any help.
I was in love once, Willow. She had a hold on my heart. I could barely function. I *was* a great swordsman! I was knighted! I could have been king!
You?
Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream.
I'll help you...!
I won't.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Did she ask about me?
Who?
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time. You were in her ten all night. Did she say anything?
She said lots of thing.s
Willow!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Well what did she say?
She's in love.
You're crazy. I think you're in love.
You?
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closedin places.
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm used to her. How's she doing?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
She's a bird, Willow.
That's my fault, not hers. I've got to keep practicing. I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and
Watch it!
Ahhh!
I have an idea. Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Willow, this is war, not agricul ture!
I know, I know! But this is a way to get into that castle...
I don't know, Willow.
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter. She is all that matters. Are you going to abandon her?
Willow, why don't you use your mag ic to get us out of here?
He's no magician.
He turned that monster into stone!
Then you get us out of here.
I will! But I need help!
Who is that girl, anyway?
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
We're a tiny version of all that?
As above, so below.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
You! Are you the mother of that child?
No. I mean yes.
I can't.
Let me see it.
I can't.
Why not?
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
You're not a woman.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
My stepfather's going to tear you apart.
I do what I'm told.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
You're a fool. Now put her back.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Why did you say that?
Say what?
I love you.
Because it's true.
I don't believe you.
Sorsha.
Madmartigan.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
I have no family.
Sir! I have to talk to you.
Not today, Willow.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Now, you know where you're going? Down there, through those trees, follow the river. You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc ture. Willow, this is serious business. Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn. Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
You're strong enough. But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I don't want courage. I don't want to be a warrior. All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others. You lack faith in your self. You must learn to trust your intuition.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Oh, if I could do that I'dI'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Waste magic on revenge? You have much to learn, Willow...
Willow Ufgood.
Yes...?
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
She belongs to all of us. She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
No, Willow. Your journey has just begun. It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world. Upon you depends this princess's life.
Me?
You are the guardian, Willow. You must take her to Tir Asleen.
What is Tir Asleen?
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago. Her name is Fin Raziel.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
You are very important, Willow.
No I'm not. Have you really looked at me? I'm short! Even for a Nelwyn!
Why can't you do it? You have mag ical powers.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest. But I can give you these...
They look like acorns.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
We're going into battle, little one. Find a woman to take care of it.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Madmartigan! What did you do this time?
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Airk! Come on, Airk. Lemme outa here.
Hey, remember? You don't need my help, Madmartigan. Little rabbit trap like this? Come on! I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
Gimme a sword, Airk. I'll win your war for you.
You left me to die, friend.
You managed alright.
Is this what's left of your army?
It's you they're after, Madmarti gan. What did you do this time?
They're not after me. They want the baby.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock maar army. Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Then come with us.
You're chasing a dream.
Just get me some horses.
Out for a little ride in the coun try, Airk?
Thought you might get lonely, Mad martigan!
Thank you, friend.
Let's go.
Well?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
They're rounding up a posse. Figure an hour?
In an hour they're gone!
Hey...!
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Right.
Dr. Pemberton?
Yes!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Who were they? What do they want with me?
We'll explain on the way.
I only met him once, but that was enough. For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself. He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him. He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place. He had all sorts of specifications. But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman. Both he and his partner had no real love of steam. It's sad. So few men do.
Who was this partner of his?
A Southern gentlemen. I don't recall his name. I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
A glass eye? That's who it was! OneEyed Jack Garrison. Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army. I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him. He used to wear an eyepatch.
Are you all right?
For the moment. But I fear not for long. I'm of no use to him now.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
This is something.
It's a smelting retort.
Now it's a bomb.
It is?
I beg your pardon?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
Thank you. I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Very good, sir! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really? Must be a dangerous business.
I deal with some tough customers.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
How embarrassing. Did I hold up three fingers?
Why don't we just cut this routine short? Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
Talk? About what...? Oh! About who you are and all that?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire. You're breathing on my head! I hate it when you breath on my head!
Dr. Loveless?
You're not that big.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire. He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Still alive. Hmm. I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
He had a pressing engagement.
Philistine.
You got that right. Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline addled skull that you are surrounded by seventyeight of my loyal followers? You are in my domain!
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Exactly! You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces. Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Call it what you like. The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West. It belonged to my beloved grandmother! Now I intend to have it back. My own country!
I've even printed my own currency.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
The first.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West! A town a day will disappear! Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park. Next, I level all of Albuquerque! Yes, that's right. Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there. What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me! After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Easy now.
Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir. Sorry about all that.
That'll be all, boys.
Good work. Really.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...? Unless it were a foreign power.
Exactly. Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth. And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science. And it is the Godgiven destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Nicely said, sir.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Goddamnit! What am I doing? What's happened to all my cigars? Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year. No arrests, no leads, no clues...
And?
And now the job's yours.
... well, of course you can. Mr. President, what a surprise. What brings you here?
On my way to Denver...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
He didn't. That's your job. I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck. Nice train. But mine's nicer.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Well, yes sir. A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories. And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man. And he's no ordinary Marshal. He's quite sophisticated. Three college degrees. A master of disguise. Speaks French...
French?
Yes sir.
French? Damn it, I want my own man on this case. Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake. I mean...
A mistake? To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry? How is that a mistake?
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Your private train, sir.
Private train?
That would be correct. Orders from the President himself. Trans portation at your beck and call. No delays. Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Doyle's the name, sir. Of the Connemara Doyles. And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself. That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way! Your friend's already aboard.
My friend?
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
I would, Mr. Doyle! Are you game?
My name's Tyler. Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
I get that feeling. You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearlhandled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Please do. I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Really?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas.
My... the wild west.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Your guests, ma'am?
Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Oh, don't worry. I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You most certainly do.
You must excuse the Doctor. No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
I don't like to lose, either.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You tell me.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
I suppose so. But life can be hard for a man, too.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Would that include me?
Oh, I would hope not.
You've... done... this... before.
I've had some practice.
She's perfectly safe.
Really? Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
My. It's gotten longer.
You bring the best out in a man.
I try. Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Fine, I'll stop.
A new friend?
We'll see.
Anyone?
Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Wonderful! Our new friend from the wild west. Please...
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Terribly sorry. I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong. Federal agents, ma'am. We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Yes, me!
You? Dr. Pemberton? Of course. How novel.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
He calls it the Tarantula.
But it only has six legs.
He's not giving up?
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Like hell! I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
J. S. Bach.
Jim West.
Artemus Gordon. Bach, he's the composer.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Valet? You jest of course. I am a U.S. Marshal.
Funny. So am I.
Congratulations. Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Your train? Listen, friend, you're obviously lost. ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Interesting. Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Just another bureaucratic foulup. You know how these pencilpushers are. So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same. Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir. And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smoothtalks his way into my assignment.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
But don't pull that again.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Eight scientists. Eight different fields of endeavor. Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Put them all together and what do we have?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes? Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Then why kidnap them? Why not just kill them?
"Ay, there's the rub." Take a look at this file on Professor Morton. Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Sorry. Didn't mean that. Just a little device of mine...
Wait a minute. Now I know where I've heard of you. You're the gadget guy.
"Gadget guy?" While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Attractive buttons, yes? But yank one off, toss it, and poof! It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
You need that real often?
Always hoping. Or this...
No offense, but all I ever need... Are these... And this.
Good Lord, man. The world is changing. And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention. We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Try what?
Your little jackinthebox gun. That might be useful.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
I'll work on it.
Aha!
Aha?
Yes, aha. A brass screw.
Is this leading somewhere?
Potentially. This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues. The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology. Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Starting with a screw?
Yes. Starting with a screw. Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
What about the explosive?
Limestone quarry?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Absolutely. Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Doyle, once around the park. I need a moment to prepare.
Prepare what?
My disguise. And here...
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
That's a lot of butler.
Quite. Come, let's mingle.
Do your own mingling. I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton. I knew it. He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine. I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Whoa, Jim. Maybe. But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
All right. How about this? We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Then we've got our proof. Excellent. And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Almost?
Yes. Now, observe....
You feeling all right?
Come on, Jim. I'm serious. Dot... Dash. It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
Now, what was that?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
What was all that back there?
All what?
All that jumping and kicking.
That? Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco. Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Garrison...? Then the President was right. Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
I'm going to hit you.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
It's a repeating steam cannon!
At least I tried something.
Hey, I tried the board.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it. Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
That's right... That's good.
Jim, are you all right?
No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas. Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
What way is that?
So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
"Spontaneous." I like that. Most people say something like "hare brained reckless sonofabitch."
Well... that, too.
Nothing much to it really. When I was younger I got into a pretty bad runin with the Wyler Boys. I saw them coming. But I didn't act fast enough. Secondguessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
So... what happened?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
I was six. And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
You might have mentioned you had that.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
They're so precious when they're asleep.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Can you fill me in here?
Sure. We have no idea what's going on.
Thank you.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
You go ahead. I'll stick with Loveless.
Know what this is?
Sure. It's a windup... thing.
A cylinder recorder. My own design.
This is good.
Shhh! Come on. Tell us something!
Oh, damn! That's it.
It's better than nothing.
It is?
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
No record of him.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
What's this?
Sounds like a train. Looks like a train.
Yes. And a much nicer one than ours.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota... Willard, New Mexico?
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Relax. We're almost there.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets. Voom! We're there before we left!
What is that?
This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
And people are actually fooled by that?
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case. I spent three years on the stage, you know. Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Not again.
I adjusted it.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
When we find him, he is mine.
Oh, no, we split him fiftyfifty.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Not likely. There must be tracks of twenty different wagons. Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Excellent detective work, sir. You should have the honor of going first.
Oh, thank you.
My pleasure.
Artemus, you ready for this? His next target is Albuquerque.
What? President Grant is...!
I know! I know!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
We've got to stop him right here, now! With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
There's only seventyeight.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
It was in your book.
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Of course not.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Thank you.
God in heaven, what is that?!
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
My God! He's so excessive!
Where have you been?
Pull the balloon right in front of him! We'll board the damn thing!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
The machine was stopped! It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He was going to shoot me! Do you mind?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay. I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
In the next two minutes?
Artemus! Look at that. Brand spanking new. She's a beauty, huh? Let's get rolling.
What is this? A whole new train?
Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
I'm sure we will.
What? You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Hi, Sandy.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Can't. Got a passenger.
I can't, Sandy. I've got to run.
I'll bet. Look, Sam. Why don't you come by this weekend. We'll take the boat out...
Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans.
What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time.
Sandy... What's up?
Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
Didn't you see her this morning?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Look. I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter. So what?
So maybe I'm a onewoman man.
Grab a clue, Sam. You're a hired hand around here. Enjoy it while it lasts.
Goodbye, Sandra.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Jesus. Two million one hundred thirtythree thousand three hundred thirtythree and change.
Sam...
Put Kelly on too.
But I..
Shut up. Don't fall apart. The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, right.
Good. Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
I was worried about you, Suzie. I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Are you mad at me?
No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight.
That was about as grim as it gets.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
But then it is better this way, don't you think? No loose ends.
What?
That was the same thing Ray said.
What's wrong?
Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
Seems to like some of the same places you do. Funny you never met.
Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Trust me, the guy's dirty. He'll like it. Especially the part about offing me. Now get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it. What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
We?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
How...
Walter. He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Story's the same, Detective...
I had to go look for this coupon.
The one you bought at school.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. Anyway, I'm going through a drawer. I hear a car. I look out the window. I see Nicole driving away. I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
In cutoffs, a wet Tshirt.
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I could, but it's confidential. Look, the point is, we didn't talk. I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her.
Yes. Mainly to turn her toward the door. I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
But she ran away.
That's right.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
With a thirtyfive inch bustline in a wet Tshirt with no bra...
Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta here.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle? Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it. We should be celebrating. This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
You mean this thing?
Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Jesus, man... You okay?
That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
I did. At Blue Balls.
It's Celine. He's okay. He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
No.
Will they?
It doesn't look like it.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a twotine loser.
You got something against cigarettes?
Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you...
That's cop bullshit.
Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.
Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
You, Kelly, Sam.
I don't have to listen to this. And you can't shove me around. I have friends now...
Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you?
I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends...
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Get away from me.
Don't you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pillhead with the rap sheet?
Shut up.
Davy.
That's right. That was his name.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Shoulda, coulda, woulda... Get him in the water.
Sam, for godsake.
Hey, Ray. Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
That's right.
Who is it?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.
Where is she?
Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
You can't...
Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
But check this...
Ken. I'm in some trouble. I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Good thinking.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Forget it.
Lady has some deep pockets. That's all I'm saying.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken. I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Not in here. Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
You're not in bad shape, really. I know you think you are, but you're not. Let me tell you why. Sandra Van Ryan.
What's that supposed to mean?
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up. Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared. And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Sound nice? It's a fucking drug rehab farm. It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp. Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury. Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet. Reason? They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty. Now tell me I'm right.
There's nothing for them to get.
Good. So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep. We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back. They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
I just want my life back...
Fair enough. Let's go make a statement.
Come on, let loose!
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay. I lost the house. It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?
Just like that? These people ruined your life, bro.
Okay, try me on Sunday. I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday. You guys can wash the mud off.
Deal. You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?
Don't forget the car wash.
I won't.
Look, he forgot. I knew it.
No I didn't. Check out the Jeep. It's nice and dirty for you. But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Where's the hose? We can set up.
In back of the garage.
So, where you off to now?
Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
All right. I'll have to look for it.
Mr. Lombardo. We're running kind of late. How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons? You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Kelly...
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust. How do you like that? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
So you got my mom's money.
How much?
About six and a half million dollars.
God, you scared the shit out of me. You must be crazy coming here.
Of course I'm crazy. Ask my mom.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental. I thought that was understood...
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Do it to ourselves?
We have to stick with the plan.
Stick?
Kelly. Is Suzie there?
Yes.
Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
Why can't you come...
No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
You know what it takes.
Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay?
I'm here.
Okay. I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool. All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake. I'm doing what rich guys do. I'm spending my money. It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing. Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it...
There was no way. That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello?
Hello.
God, I've been calling you.
I'm really serious. That cop, he keeps watching me.
Duquette. Forget him...
I can't help it. He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
And you believe her?
I don't know. I want to see you...
Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're rich.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead. Stay in the guest house. Skip the graduation parties. You'll never see Duquette. Okay? I love you.
Okay. I love you too.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
I love you. Now give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
I'm running away.
You think that's wise?
Umhuh. And guess what else? I have toys.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
Sam! Hi!
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Whichever one I want.
Okay, what's the matter?
You notice my new jumper?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
No thanks to you.
Kelly. What is it?
I miss Dad.
Jesus. Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
What?
I was raped. By Sam Lombardo.
He... Sam Lombardo?
Yes. God, Mom...
You didn't have to fly back  from  wherever, for me...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children. I'm leaving again tonight.
Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Curiosity, I guess.
About what? How to improve your breast stroke?
Excuse me?
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
You're out of your mind.
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pillhead around, now that you have the money?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Police  God  get a life.
Get off my property.
I'm not on your property!
Will you calm down. Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me. You've got family and they've got clout. With we it's different... with me...
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You are.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What brain?
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Shit.
It's those rocks, up there.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Lombardo ever come out here?
I say something funny?
No. But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Yeah, but...
Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it?
No!
Thank you, Jimmy.
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class... No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Hey, you're working for it. Least you're supposed to be.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
What?
A ride. You want one?
Yeah. But I got my bike.
You guess? Did he or didn't he?
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
I wanna go home now.
What did you do then?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Suzie! Did this man rape you?
Okay! He did. He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. Now, can I go home?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I'm sorry... you said it hurt? Why?
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
Ms. Toller?
I said he did.
Ms. Toller. I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
This wasn't my idea.
I'm sorry?
He was my friend at first. Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me. I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares? You wanna know something? When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette. Now they're gonna get screwed.
Your Honor... Please...
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her. That's bullshit.
What about witnesses?
We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
And what do they say?
Are you crazy, Ray?
You heard Kelly say "Sam." That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls...
Ray. The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I don't believe I'm hearing this. A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. They were acting. They were all acting, from the beginning. And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Oh, Ray... no...
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish? Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath. And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
Get off this Ray, now. If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide. You get an ID, you call me.
I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
Just tell us what happened.
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights.
She bit you?
Bit, scratched. But I had her pinned. She calmed down. I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick. She asked to use the bathroom.
I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together.
You didn't cuff her?
She looked shaky, but lucid. I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door... I think I looked away. A split second. Then, bingo. Just like that. She puts a knee into my groin. There was this coffee table between us and the wall. She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. Thing had a glass door. I could hear it breaking. I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. I yelled at her to put it down. She got off a shot. I took it in the shoulder. I... I had no choice. I returned fire. Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
The teeth, were they...
Suzie Toller's. And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Why?
I think she's acting. I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
That doesn't make him a child rapist. There's something else. This girl's had some problems. Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars. Ran away...
Where's this coming from?
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I want a fullscale investigation.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
I don't care. You heard that girl's statement. I think he's dirty. Get me a case.
That bothers you?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
No.
So you were alone.
Yes.
Did he come in with you?
I guess.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go.
He did say something.
What was that?
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
I've got that two o'clock in town.
Back to the land of grownups.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
It's our job, Gloria.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do. We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
Same as him. They saw her come. They saw her go. They saw him follow.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her. I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there. Same with the kids. They saw her running down the street, but that's it. With no physical evidence, what do we have? Her word against his.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark. You know what you get? More bark. And more bark. There's no core. Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water. And now they can't get rid of them. They've tried poisons. Nothing works. They don't die.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his. I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
The skinny brunette.
This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You mean Camp SixtyNine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile. It's a pretty dismal place.
It's a shithole. But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
You saw the news today?
Lombardo's settlement?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right? So why not tell us about the affair? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless...
Unless what?
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
So what about the girls? Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother? Surely her father...
Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Eliminate the competition.
You got it. The rich got richer. While the saps like Lombardo went bellyup in the swamp.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
I net a guy in a bar.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
What? You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? Cone on. She bought the same story we did...
Guess I kind of lost it there.
You could say that.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
We all have...
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. I did that once. I don't want to do it again.
It's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins...
Ray. We don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
You have someplace to be?
If you want company...
Just check out the car.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Where's the body?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away. And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
We don't know that, Ray...
Will you do me one favor?
Ray, you heard him...
What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth  it's a promise.
I'm tired, Ray. I'm going home.
Where's Lombardo?
He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it. I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda. I'll see you get a proper tour.
I'd like that.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab.
Did you call anyone? Did you call her house to see if she got home? Did you call the Masons?
No.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. There's phones there. I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found. I don't know... Maybe I should have called. But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself. I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Suzie Toller is missing.
How long?
She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Maybe she used another name.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
I don't know what to say...
You could tell me where you were last night.
Kelly's file. Read it. You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
Suzie?
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
I know you do.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind. His fingers... his fingers...
Take your time.
They were in me. Both places... you know.
I understand.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something. I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you?
Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me...
That's okay, Kelly. You're doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt. Was this the first time a man was inside you?
No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
He was large?
Did you try to fight him?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew...
Not at first. He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything... He said we had this secret. And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that. I don't know. It's hard to remember, exactly.
Try, Kelly.
I know one thing he said. It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up. He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that. He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit. They see out the sides. That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
About Suzie?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
He used to come around here. He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
She still work there?
No. Not after that night. I don't know what happened. Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy. Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night. It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away. That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here. He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes. One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp. That came with her.
And the child...
She had it, before she drank herself to death. Wasn't exactly a love child...
Suzie. Then you're not her grandmother...
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child. He was a good boy, till the army took him.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half sisters.
And the other girl, Kelly. Suzie's niece.
You okay?
I'm fine. Nice TV.
How soon can we get something?
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer. You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Merritt, Forensics.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...
What about the blood?
Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Eat a power bar.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Kelly.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Senior class fundraising gig. I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep. Hey, come on. It's for a good cause.
You look pretty.
Thanks.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
And where might that be?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you.
I'd like that.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Talk to me Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
... is accusing me of rape. Jimmy told me. Apparently I'm the last to know...
Sam... I... Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long. She's pushing for suspension...
This is insane.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there. They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
That's great. I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist. No problem... Shit. I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle. You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam. You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
How you doing, Artie?
I... You know... I...
In a hurry, are we?
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
Bad news.
People pay good money for that?
I'm just a messenger.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
It's about your parents.
My parents? What do you mean?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further. Skinnydipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
How quaint.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire. You own it now. Any questions?
Smashing! Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
I have only one concern...
You do like girls, don't you?
Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
As much as possible.
You're sure?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Seldom? No kidding?
Ah, in other words, this is the apresorgy salon?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
Tipping?
There you are, Tedbaby. Everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's cool.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
They said that? Really? Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I do?
You are a multimedia magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
Me? The King of Coitus?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Whoa. But...that's the thing... I've never even actually...
Why, look who's here.
I told you you could do it.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
Really? You'd do that for me?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
What kind of ideas?
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
You think we should be more open minded?
The world is a big, beautiful place. We can open new markets in Africa and Asia. Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
That's perfect.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part. For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
My father must've been amazing.
He was in a league of his own.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books. Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
Yes?
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Tedbaby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution... And I think we all know what that is
PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
What are you doing?
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
All is fair in "Heaven," Tedbaby.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every redblooded, heterosexual male's dream.
I never figured you for a pimp.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others. Ever hear of the First Amendment?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Rules are rules.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
I'm warning you.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
That's part of growing up, honey.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
What about Charlie? You boys could make it a little adventure.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking good care of you?
Yeah, I'm doing fine. I have so much to tell you. I don't even know where to begin.
Save it, honey. We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
It's okay, Mom. Trust me.
Well? Surprised?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
I'll make you very proud.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
But how would we pay our bills?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
Oh. Goodness.
You're free. You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Like what?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
But who would run the store?
Forget the store. Think big.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
I need your help. I'm really in deep shit.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pickup.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Meow.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I have absolutely no intention
Do it. I tripledogdare you.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
But you tripledogdared me.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's CroMagnon Man of the Year.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Your article sucked.
In what sense?
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Me?
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Really? You wanna write about me?
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I don't get the distinction.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
I guess.
Interesting.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
You never know around here.
Don't write that part.
Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor, you are extremely cavalier.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
Well? What do you think of her?
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Wow...you clean up nice.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Where are we going?
To the best hiding place in the world.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
Not "whatever." It's two different things.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
I see.
I doubt it.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
Your dad taught you everything.
I mean my father.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's all so complicated.
It's incredibly simple.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Eventually you'll let go.
And then what?
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
You're amazing.
I know.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
But you never do.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He shut down your paper! You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
That's probably my office.
Well? Where the hell are you?
He's on the move?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Let's do it.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattleprodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
At least it's not another 4H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Amen to that.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I'm trembling with excitement.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Wearing them? Or humping them?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
That's refreshingly deviant.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I see.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Not a chance.
Come on.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
I want you to trust me.
Maybe someday.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
That's hard to believe.
But absolutely true.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
You think you're working with chimps here?
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
Very ambitious. I like that.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!" An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
I know where you can find an excellent editorinchief.
Yellow pages?
Let your fingers do the walking.
They're playing our song. Dare I ask for this dance?
You better.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
James, what are you doing here?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
Most places are, Jimmy.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My new bike.
Very funny.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
My room?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a nobrainer.
It's not up to me.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
If you could just sign right there.
You want it in writing?
Just a formality.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Are they okay?
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
I miss them, too.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
You're a peach.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
He was my Grandfather, too.
I meant biologically.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kickass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
I didn't forget.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
Great.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
You're on the next plane home.
I'm Helen McDole. Your father's executive secretary.
No problem, consider it done. I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again. Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
You mean they knew who I was?
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
My legacy.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
I understand.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Can you believe that was me?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Everything.
II don't have the keys.
They're in the ignition, silly.
You do know how to drive?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
Want a lesson?
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
Got it.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
I know. I'm Ginger. Miss April.
The one with the horses.
That's me.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry. He found the chocolate room.
Hi ho, Silver.
Who exactly ARE you?
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Hmmm?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Whatever you want.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
Of course we were.
Ted! Do something!
What do you want me to do?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Well?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous... We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
It's my private business! Mine!
I remember spring break of my senior year. Seems like a lifetime ago.
Dad, please.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
You're way ahead of me again?
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
The lesson being?
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I'm getting so good at this.
You guys are my parents.
Of course we are.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Son.
Well, why should I?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a twobit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
I guess.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Yeah.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
...not the pit.
Ted, it's your dad. I have a question for you. I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Just say it, Dad.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Finally, some gratitude.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Sorry I
It's okay. You need me?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
You ordered a Winnebago?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Watch your tone, mister.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I will not have my boys arguing.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We own a small family grocery store.
We can't accept it. It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Sweetheart, what is it?
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We love our lives just the way they are.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the socalled "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We miss our family.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ladies first. I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
And I was wondering.
Yeah?
If you don't have...I mean...
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
But that smile.
Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
So you'll think about it?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
So that's a maybe?
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Yeah? You like?
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Christy? You want to be in "Heaven?"
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Do it?
You know...take the pictures?
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Which you pulled, hard!
That was code for "I like you."
Remember dress up day? You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
Well?
You have changed since second grade.
I mean, what do you think?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. Are you hungry?
God, you are so hot.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Never say never.
Oh, god. Look. Look.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
Let me get this straight...
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
These are real, live women?
We don't generally feature blowup dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
God, I love being dead.
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
You and your pep talks.
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like meltinyourmouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
That's Charlie. My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been overtenderizing your meat, again.
See? Did you see that?
She smiles at everyone, Ted. She's like a newborn with gas.
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April. "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback. My biggest turnoff is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip: set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube. Don't knock it till you tried it.
Were you always this sick?
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
Someday, I'll find out.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
That's crazy talk.
I defy any and all limits.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin! Aw, who are we kidding...
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Astronomical.
Who the hell was your father?
Well, Dad said...
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Maybe he got promoted.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Cut it out, before you break something!
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babealicious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
Perv.
This is like my every wet dream come true. I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Not ever. Never.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
So far away? In Xenia?
Yeah, whatever.
Check this out. Hurry!
I better go, Dad.
Hurry.
What is it now?
Check it out!
Don't tell me. Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Dead?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
And some really fast cars.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
Take a whiff of heaven.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different. She wasn't your mother mother
Give me those!
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
You're late, bro!
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You'll never believe who's in there.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I thought I loved her.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
I love those springy head puppies!
Get them together.
Brilliant! Molly, give me all you've got. For Merk.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
Dr STECKLER?
Yes...?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR  Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
Dead?
Or was it, she wished he was dead  that's it  I believe he left the country with another woman  all rather sordid.
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
No  she isn't in any trouble is she?
Oh no sir  just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you  she'll understand
I'll be sure to...
I shouldn't really  I'm not your surgeon...
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Sugar?
Yes  one please.
ANGEL...
Yes, sorry  He's here to make sure that you are alright
I'm really very sorry  I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
No  a dentist
Just put it in my room
No worries
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Don't worry about it 
You're a novelist  why didn't you tell me?
And not just any novelist  a great novelist  it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Her husband left her
Oh...
I thought it was you  how are you?
I'm good  I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Yes, come on in...
That's good
I'd really like it if you would come round some time  Then I could cook you a meal  what do you say...
Yes, that would be nice  I'll call round some time...
Good  I've got to dash  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Yes  of course.
It's been what, three years?
What's this all about?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband  It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean? I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now  and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN  It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
At home alone  where were you?
As it happens, I was at home alone  maybe we could solve each others problems?
Get out...
I'd watch her mate  she has thing for men  they disappear near her.
I think you had better leave
I'm sorry, I couldn't  when is she due?
At 2.00...
Well, what do you think?
I don't know  it's your house ELLEN
Yes  but you live here too  If it were your house?
I think he's fine  I don't know why you have this thing about men  it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change  I don't think he would hurt a fly.
What's wrong with you?
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
What?
You heard me  keep away from him
You don't own him you know  you can't tell me not to see him!
Yes I can...
I want you out now
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm your landlady
What happened?
I had an accident  I fell down stairs...
Is LESLIE here?
No he had to  he's just  he's out...
He saved my life you know  has he told you...
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I really don't know what to say
Oh  Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Sure...
Tell me  ELLEN CARTER Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book  'The Color of Fear'?
I lost the touch
The touch?
Do you take sugar?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
What are you doing?
I'm sorry?
What's with all the locks  and hammering
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted  is there a problem ANGELA?
My names isn't ANGELA...
Yes  I'm sorry ELLEN...
Don't worry  Is that my hammer Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
If you want any  there's some left in the kitchen
I think I will pass...
Sugar?
Yes, one and a half please.
So what do you do?
I'm a dentist
And how long have you been a dentist?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
You don't know?
No  the police say I've killed fourteen  but I've not  I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden  I probably couldn't even show you where I put them  one girl, number eight I think the press called it  she wasn't even mine  I don't know who did it but I didn't
Where do you kill them...
Oh anywhere  whenever I needed to  Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets  they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say  and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie  she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck  She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife  she just froze, and said  what do you want?  I said, You know what I want.  But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy  the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight. The real problem with my work is the blood  there is so much of it  and it all spurts out so fast  like a fountain. It made such a mess of
my car I stopped working from my car. She could have stopped me you know  If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast  If a dog attacked you  you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself  Why then do people get bitten by dogs  savaged? Why?
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us  that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting  men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft  women are making them soft  by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty  she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention so she doesn't deserve any more 
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
No she didn't...
What did you do with her?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick  the press, the TV  but I'm not you know  they are  I don't watch it for entertainment every night  I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner  they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead  I can't hurt something dead  And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen  I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them!
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman  why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
I don't want to talk about it 
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white  why white  white clothes, blonde hair...
I don't know...
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours  so what are people who wear white?
I don't know...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
Why should I feel sorry  they're dead.
How long have you been watching me?
I have something I have to show you...
Tell me about your wife...
My wife My wife was the only one who really deserved it. LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do  she mothered me...
then why did you marry her 
It seemed like a good idea at the time  why did you marry your husband.
What didn't you like about her?
I hated being treated like a failure  looked down on  my sister used to do that  I hated it  I should have known, when we got married  in a registry office of course  she wore maroon  I just wanted a white wedding I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut  I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband  but I am no killer.
You've killed but you're not a killer
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same  we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation  not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick 
Tell me how it happened...
Why should I?
Why not? Please  it would help me
And how did it feel to be rid of him
Wonderful  like a great release  He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him  the world is better without him
My mother...? I never knew my real MOTHER  I was adopted
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
Did you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
STEPHANIE?
My sister  My ADOPTED SISTER 
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
STEPHANIE loved me  she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me  she was just old enough. We had a ball for years  we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games  she would be the executioner and I would be the convict  She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
It was wrong  all my life I have been cheated  cheated of anything good  I shouldn't have been born  I was a mistake  my natural mother was a whore  that makes me...
I want it to stop  it all to stop...
Then make it stop...
What?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong  I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done  I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN  I can see clearer now...
What's wrong?
Nothing could be better...
What's wrong?
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think  look into myself  I haven't dared look into myself for a long time  I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on  I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life  I want a second chance...You are good to me  you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
What is it?
Open it...
Yes...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
But for how long  what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat  and that will be it  back on the merry go round...
Where are you going?
Out  I may be some time
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE I'm sorry  I  I didn't know what to think
I thought we had a relationship built on trust  and you just slap me in the face...
I am sorry...
LESLIE? Is that good enough?
Yes  I suppose so...
ELLEN, would you like a cup  there's plenty in the pot
No thanks 
First finish your tea...
He doesn't need to...
Why did you let him in?
What was I supposed to do?
I don't like sugar
There isn't that much  you didn't even taste it  What's wrong  don't you like my tea?
It's not that  I just don't want any sugar
Why whats wrong with the sugar 
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
CRAP!  I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE  What's wrong ELLEN  you look pale  maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately  it could be food poisoning?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Nothing LESLIE  I just think we should wait...
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm  please...
You killed my friend!
I loved you ELLEN  why did you do this?
It's what you would do to me
Don't you want me now LESLIE
No  I'll have you after
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
CHIC MAGAZINE?
Yes  it's about bank safety deposit boxes  I wonder if you might just explain how they work  and maybe even show me round.
When could I look round?
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
BRIAN...
But  If you could show me round now  and I'll meet you later?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Yes it is...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
So there is only one key...
That's right...
And it can't be forged?
I didn't say that  I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident  we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
Yes, I'm sure you could  but I can't risk you loosing your job
No it's no problem  I do it all the time
All the time?
No  not all the time  I mean
I know what you mean  I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
Hello MRS STECKLER  we haven't seen you for a long time
No  I've been abroad for a long time...
I shouldn't say this  but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh really  you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER  don't you remember?
I'm terribly sorry  I have a bad memory...
This must be one of the old keys 
Yes  I have had it for years.
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left  definitely...
Don't give me shit  what do you want?
I've got a tenant coming over later  can I take the afternoon off?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
That's not technically accurate  SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
I heard something like that
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features  if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym  then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling  I know you need this job  and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
OH MY GAWD!
I'm sorry  I didn't think
A person could get killed round here just for working late
I thought you were someone else
Well I'm glad I'm not them  what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
I thought someone was following me  I  er  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks  is that OK?
Why don't you take a few weeks off  you're due some holiday time.
Sounds good  thank you
Don't mention it  now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Papers...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage. Rowan  there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael that is it's in the will  for centuries. Tradition enjoins, Rowan. of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into 
I've decided not to open a practice here I want to set up a research clinic. For infant genetic disorder.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that. Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could 
No tax shelters. No funding. I want to fund the clinic  exclusively. The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic. I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately  while we draw up plans for new construction.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Rowan Mayfair.
Sut McKinley. Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
Hey  I love gloves I look really great in gloves.
I like him. He can stay.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Is that what you were doing...?
Mikey  pregnant women get crazy you know that. I mean  hell, they're all crazy anyway  right...?
Comes running out the front door  down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool. Aloof.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change. You always do.
I just  hate it when they're  finished.
Go home, Stu I'll call you.
Bullshit! Let me in! Mikey  there are people who can help figure this ont.
On which planet...?
You can't just 
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
Well, Normie  you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time. How are the hands...?
The guy I told you about  Aaron...? He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
'Leave bees be  and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
That's a wasp. Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored so  where is she...?
Wow...
If you like that type.
You okay...?
Just nervous. Getting married, you know. Got the rings...?
I'm getting  left behind.
Left behind...? This about Rowan...?
Yes. Partly. It's  it's  Stu  do you believe in 
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville. Oh, sweet decadance.
Just don't fall off any ladders.
They like you  kids.
I guess so. The trick is remembering how to act like one. I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you. Why don't we go to my office...
I've read the stories  and seen the news coverage.
'Freak at the week.' That's what the TV crew. call it people come right to the house. They have a husband or wife who skipped town  or a missing kid They bring a sweater or a toy  and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I don't remember you at all You  you saved my life Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
My jury's still out on that,
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you  death is not the preferable alternative. I'm in the life business  remember..?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision  that keeps pouring into my head It won't go away God  if I could just understand it.
What do you see...?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing
Just one. The bar's closed.
The one time I want it to work...
You know  doors and keyholes are common signposts in outofbody 
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygenstarved brain  and nobody 
No. I'm not. Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
Harder...
Rowan...
HARDER!
Like this...? LIKE THIS...?!
Yessssss...
you're very  different.
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
What else did you see Michael...?
What're you  a mindreader...? Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
My uncle. Graham. He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me. He  he  had a stroke Just before Ellie died  of cancer. Last year.
You knelt there, helpless You couldn't save him. There was so such anger in you. Death infuriates you...
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
It  it feels like  like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself. Like I'm fading away
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside. The Queen's house. the Gangster's house. the clown's house Like that.
And whose houses do you design...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's... The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
You still feel that crazy...?
I was born, in New Orleans, too
Really...? Your family there...?
Nope My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth. El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Too much... too fast...?
Mmhmm. Scared I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
He fools around with his patients too.
you touched him  and saw him...? What was he doinging. Kinky...?
It's come to that, huh...? Three weeks  and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
You look very deep when you do that. It's interesting. We're Complete opposites I'd never just sit and wait for insparation. I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Ms. yin, and Mr. yang Aha!
YUHEEYAH. Yuheeyah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Okay. y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon  yu'heeyah.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders  ?
Captain's orders.
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
All I meant was 
You don't know what you meant  because you don't know me.
Christ, Michael  what the hell are we doing...? We don't even know 
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
I'm serious. You don't 
Let's see... Next you tell me all the terrible things about you  and prove that we're doomed to fail  right...? you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really 
Stop it.
You stop it. you're loving, and gentel.. You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met  so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared. Cause it won't work.
Seems more like a year than a month.
Michael  this place is increadible. You  you're brilliant... The things you created...
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute In L.A., remember...? He said he'd see you. He was intrigned.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
MICHAEL +++$+++
You could fly down tomorrow. I could be there the next day I think I can last that long without you.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Mad. for each other.
Hello...?
Michael! Jesus I've been trying 
Rowan...?
Listen. Last night  oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What's wrong..?
Michael  I have to go  to New Orleans. I'll  I'll call yati when I 
What about you coming down here...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans. Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me. I'll call you there.
Wait a minute. Rowan  what is going on...?
Goodbye, Michael. I love you.
You know...?
I know. It's not possible  but I know.
She  she said I  I was a 
 a witch.
It could've been a tornado  or a  a hurricane. Maybe 
Michael  I saw him! Twice! Carlotta said I  killed Graham  with  with my anger.
Ro  you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings. I mean  that's CRAZY.
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...? God, Michael  what am I...?
C'mon. Let's go to the ho
He's in there! Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?! where are you, goddamnit...?!
Even if it's all true  that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon. And my life is not a cosmic whim! I am in charge of my life   and I want to stay. Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me. Helpless. I should have been here.
Rowan... Think of what's in that book. Think of last night!
I am! And so are you. You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause) Michael, if you don't want 
Do you love me, Michael...?
Yes. I love you. Very much.
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time. I want to stay here  with you.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
What about your work back home...?
They need doctors in New Orleans too. Michael  think what I could do with the money!
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Let's see.
You sure...?
It's the next best thing to being there'  right...?
Everyone  this is Michael curry.
Hello..
Michael  this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
He can't hurt us, Michael. It's us  our love. He can't find a crack in it. He can't find a way in.
Maybe he's just  waiting...
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
I don't think of us that way  ever.
Either do I. I love you, Ro. You know that. You're a total mystery to me  but I love YOU.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael. I could put a spell on you  and make you say yes.
You're a very bad witch, you know that...?
No, I'm very good  and you aught to know.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Hey  I'm getting married in the morning  I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
I took off my gloves today  with Aaron   and it was okay.
That's GREAT!
Guess so. I keep thinking about the witches  when I was... down there There was  caring. They saved me, Ro. They said 'go back'... Wel1 I came back  to you  to love you. I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence 
Their what...?
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Wanna snack...?
A little wine...?
Hey  you're bleeding.
Dropped it.
You look a little green.
Mmhmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Mmhmm...
Gee  look at that. I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Mmhmm...
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Did you see the old man on the 
Michael!
No  I didn't kill him. Would you rather I'd let them kill us  after they'd raped me...?
No. This is unreal...
It's not some fairytale in an old book. Michael  look at me. I didn't choose this, Michael. This is who I am. I love you.
I love you too.
Fall in New Orleans... This whole town is waterlogged! The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
That's cause we're below sea level.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
That's not funny.
You did that, didn't you...?
Talking to me dear...?
Remember the first time we made love  and then 
 we made a fire.
Michael  what made you fall in love with me...?
Your beneficence.
I'm serious. Whatever it was  it's still there inside me, isn't it  change and all...?
You alright...?
A little sore. Darm... Finish up my section, will ya...?
Is he  is he gonna die...?
Lock the door. Lock it
Michael  why would he want to hurt Stu...?
I don't know.
If it's a boy  Taylor.
A bit much. Lucas.
Nah  I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas. Grayson.
Where are you gitting these...? Aaron  if it's a boy.
When aid you get home last night...?
What were you talking about...?
Yyou look terrible. You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic. Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't 
Dovetails. Gotta be a hundred years old.
Go ahead.
Something's wrong with you.
Nothing is wrong with me. I know something's in there  and so do you.
Hi.
Hi. You  you wanna get some breakfast...? Maybe see a movie...?
I  I... I can't, Michael. There's stuff  at the clinic 
Gotcha.
You've gone away from me, Ro... Someplace I don't know how to get to.
It's not true. You have to believe me.
I can't.
That's not good enough. Why not...?!
I can't leave now. Don't ask me to explain! I just can't!
I've never asked you to explain yourself  because you used to let me inside! But I'm on the outside now... you put me there!
Michael  please  just. a little longer. Don't leave.
Why bother to ask, Ro...? Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Stop it!
How 'bout a backward hex with a threequarter twist...?
You bastard!
You could kill me  right now, couldn't you...? couldn't you...?! Tell me the truth  is it Lasher...? Answer me!!
Michael  I'm sorry... Just give me 
No.
Lasher... Where  where is 
It's alright...it's airight. He's gone, Michael... Gone.
Harder...
Rowan...
Harder...
Like this... LIKE THIS...?
Yessss...
Always loved you. Rowan. Always...
Put  him  down! His  his heart...
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Let me go... Michaelllllll...
ENOUGH! He is dead. You are here for me now. Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you. I swear it! If you don't kill me, I'll find a 
'Kill you...?' You are my mother. Do you think I would hurt you...?
I am your son. I would not wound you. I could not  ever.
I know. you are my son 
You do not love Michael How can you love  if you lie...?
Lie...?
There are things you will not tell him.
Yes, Michael. Harder. More...
Like this...?
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
Nooo... NO! Stop!
STOP!
Always loved you..
The wasps were meant for Michael  but there's only so much you can control, isn't there? The great and powerful lasher  undone by a faulty ladder.. Why would you hurt him...?! Answer me.
I 1ove you, Rowan. I've always loved you. I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts  so I could be as we are now.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!! ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Explain this to me  violated...?
You bastard...
Made it...?
It is from love.
To love, you must be able to feel.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings  . . like breeres that blow through me. Things to be felt, yes  but not nine to feel...
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose. And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
LASHER +++$+++
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I am only what you are  what all of you have been. what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I'm going to have a baby. Michael wants to name it after you  if it's a girl. Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...? Funny  I never really thought I'd ever 
I bring her flowers too.
There is no one here but the dead.
Go away! I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain  it is a Mayfair who has wanted me! suzann. and Deborah. Stella  Marguerite  Antha  Diedre  All of them. And you will have a child...
A girl...?
It's too soon to know.
you crave what I might show you. What you can learn. What I can give you. So much more than Michael can.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
I LOVE him!
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE MICHAEL. MICHAEL!!
I know that you're evil.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do... ...but Marguerite could not help me. Nor Julien...
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
No, my love. I want nothing more of the dead. I want you to  chang me.
I've waited for you  the one whose science could match her powers... Do you know what it's like  to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...? to float in a dream that keeps a .promise halfhidden in its shadows..? I did not choose to be such as this! Suzanne brought me here. She called to me!
But have I...? Ever...?!
 and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I love Michael...
Then help me for his sake...
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't  mustn't hurt..
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Only you...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Go on. Rowan. Go on.
Leave me alone!
What is wrong...?
Wrong...? Science is not magic.
I do not understand...
You went into the cells  and you changed them. How...?!
There was no thought. There was no act. That is not what I am.
I don't know what you are!!!
That is what you must discover. see what I am, my love. With all your power  see me, and know what I am.
No!
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
Aaron was in the dream. A dream tilled with spirits. you killed him, didn't you...?
It was an accident. Gifford, too.
The portraits, Lasher. Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher. Now!
They want to come back. We have a pact  of mutual desire and consent. The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry. I have weaved you all together  from the start. I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne. He had genius in him. Scientific, precise. It was a perfect start. And on it has gone  father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Oh god...
Ju1ien was your father Your greatgrandfather  your grandfather  and your father. All one in the same... That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come. Your time is gone.
No! Don't! Lasher!!!
Parents say he  uh  fell 
Anybody got a BP yet...?
 and he seemed okay. Just banged his 
FAST.
uh  then he  be just 
He just went out like & light
Massive subdural hamatoma. We have to evacuat it  right now.
I'll tell OR we're bringing 
He's herniating! Forget OR. He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray  Anesthesia  stat! We need him intubated and blow down!
Mum... Oh Mum, God will surely strike us 
Wind  I love you with that which is endless within me. Bring me your eyes  your touch  your voice...
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
The door, Michael. find the key...
Help us. Do what you can.
Michael... Do what you can.
Michael... Help us... The door!
Lasher  bring us through!
Now, lasher  it is our time.
E11ie  Diedre died at five o'clock this morning. Obviously, there are 1egal matters. Your discretion will be 
Hello...? Who is this...?
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair. Who's calling...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
I beg your par
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
This is your aunt. Carlotta Mayfair. In New Orleans.
I don't have any aunts  and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta'  or, for that matter  a 'Diedre'! Just who 
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
My...mother...?
Yes. Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate 
But my mother... Ellie said she died 
I under5tand. All the same
Ellie said she died when I was BORN! She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when 
I had you sent away.
Who the hel1 
It was quite warranted by the  situation. I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan  you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great 
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
A very tired one. I've been up all night  and I would .like to rest before the funeral. Have your lawyer 
When is the funeral...? I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
Out of the question Rowan, coming here will not change the 
I'm coming down there!! And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face! IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
You came. I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I want to see my mother. Where is she...?
In the coffin, my dear. where else...?
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I might as well be Rowan Smith  or Jones! you cut me off from every 
I'm tired. I need to rest.
There are things I have to know!
I don't want the 
Other properties as well  here and in Europe. And vest holdings  in sugar, oil, gold, electronics. Liquid funds over eighty million. tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Eighty million doll  ?
And this  if you decide to take the rest.
What is it...?
The lamplight. That's all.
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Better than most, I suppose.
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
She didn't feel them
You're a monster.
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
Why are you doing this...? Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
You have the Mayfair eyes. Tell me, Rowan  what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
He's shown himself to you... on the deck. In the storm.
'He'...?
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
It wes a dream...!
Just like your mother  and all the others that felt him  and used his power  and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
Witches. Rowan. that is what we are.
ENOUGH!!!
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones  even as she had him inside her...
You're mad! Your mind is sick!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy! you are the sum of his desires 
You  are  a  murderer.
But I had to use my hands. None before you could kill with their mind. Graham, my dear. Your uncle...?
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
I'm NOT like you! I'm NOT! You're cruel 
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where  might as well have one hell of a goingaway party.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Giff  shuttup. you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
You babbling that nonsense  now...? This is a wedding.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did. They made a deal with the devil. Y'know  "make us rich"  worship the number thirteen  the whole bit. And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Gifford Mayfair  I'll cook your tongue on a spit! witches!
Hell  Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Rowan  I'm Beatrice Maytair. Your cousin. Deedee...you'r mother and I  we  we grew up together.
I want to see my mother.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford  that box glued to your hands...?
Aren't they gauche...? Those steel things are so  common.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
You two sees like a perfect fit. Only two mounths...?
Mmhmm. Seems & lot longer.
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance  but fortune picks your partner.' Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling. Now  Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure 
I don't want it.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.' We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Then you wear it.
C'mon now  give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
It's over a month. The police say it happens all the time.
Jesus I've got  to get to the ho
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael. At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
How do you know about Rowan ...? I didn't  Cemetery...?
With her family. Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be  educated. A few hours.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
I  r saw him as a child. Lots of times... But no one else did.
Come. There is a lot to read
A what...?
A spirit. Perhaps evil... ...and he has come to you with Diedre gone  you've... inherited him.
No scaredycats in the Talamasca, huh...?
There is a difference between sensing danger  and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape, Michael...? what anchors your life...? Your work...? Your creativity...?
Rowan.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you. Take off your gloves, Michael.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Michael, Rowan should 
NO! she's pregnant, Aaron. she's got that to deal with  and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this. don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me... Listening to my heart, aren't you...? The Timex still ticking...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
"Go back, Michael. Do what you can..."
Yes  and you have. Do you see...? He was passing over into death  but the witches sent him back  to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
on't know what else to do. Maybe I just don't belong in her life. well  I'm already out of her life.
Nothing was ever more false.
Then tell me. Is it Lasher....
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house. you'll check on her  every day...?
Every day twice.
Aaron  lieten to me... It's been Lasher  from the start!
What are you talk
He chose ME for ROWAN  when I was a child!
Rowan...
You have to warn her  this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Then what is he...?
A spacial entity. An organized energy. something that precedes our definition of existence.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck  and the plane... geography seems irrelevant now.
Michael  you loved that house as a child. You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror. And Lasher with it!
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years. It's only fitting you give one af us away.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
I have seen him again. Last night.
But you've not told Michael.
Lasher will act, Rowan. Whatever it is he wants  he's waited three hundred years to have it. facing him alone... I don't like 
Lasher is my legacy  not Michael's. Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael. I can't bear to see anymore. He's not to know. Swear to me.
Are you alright...? You look pale.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health. I'm the doctor.
There are two.
Two what...?
Two heartbeats.
With his hands!
But why would they do that...?
You've always said you felt goodness in them  that the witches brought you and Rowan together. Isn't that right...? They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
But it doesn't make sense. They  they used Lasher... they conspired with him.
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought  Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood... surely they sense the child you carry  and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp... Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Would you stop it!
:Well, they are.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
I think three...
Three weeks.
What's their name?
Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic.
She's awake.
We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet.
When's she out of here?
Norman Spencer.
Alright. I can't take the rejection. I'm going to class.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the
It's Saturday.
It's today?
Yep.
Claire?
Three o'clock.
Whatcha reading?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
How is it?
Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Nice. Almost done.
If you have to work...
No, no. I'm just about... There.
How are you?
Fine.
It's okay if you're not.
I am, really.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Not the focus.
You know what I mean.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You are...
To get my life back. To have some time for myself. Some time for us.
You did a great job. She's a good kid.
We did.
It's just us now.
I know.
Tired?
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Yup.
Did you...
Shhh.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Mmm.
Maybe we should just...
Tomorrow.
I'm finished at three. No. Squash with Stan.
After that.
I'll be there.
Of what?
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
More or less.
Honey, they're young. They're probably newlyweds.
I'm telling you. There was something in her voice...
Remember how we were?
Not like this. We were never like this. I want to go over there. After dinner, we can
Why?
To make sure she's all right.
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of
That's not what I'm sug
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
But what if something happens?
Claire...
I'd never be able to live with mysel
Nothing's going to happen. Besides, I have to work tonight. The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer. This is...
I know.
It's what I've been working for.
I just wish you could have heard her.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Promise?
Norman, you have to look at this!
Mmnph.
Hurry...
Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something.
Is it gone?
Hi.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Oh.
Unless you need me to come home...
No, no. It's fine.
Claire?
Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.
What are you doing here?
There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you.
What do you mean? Some noises where?
In the house. I was scared.
Did you call the police?
No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning.
Of course.
It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering.
What kind of whispering?
I don't know. Just...whispering.
I've got the conference next week. I want you to feel safe.
I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Think I may have cracked it.
Really?
I think so. Maybe.
You are so brilliant.
Yep.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You know what that does to me.
Ohmigod. You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
You're kidding.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
Wow.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Well, that's nice.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Oh, no...
"...of Perpetual Distances." Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop. "I'm afraid you've mistaken me," I say...
That's...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
That's just mean. Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you tell her?
What? No. No.
You didn't?
Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't.
Sorry. You understand.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Huh.
Get down! He'll see.
What's going on, Claire?
Shhhh.
He killed her.
What?
He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic
No, no, no, no. The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay. It's not from here, believe me, I... All right, look at this.
Our house.
No. Look! In the window.
It's a flare.
A flare?
From the sun. It's a reflection on the glass.
It's her! I'm telling you. She whispered and turned on the music. She's trying to contact me!
It's a ghost.
Where is she then?
She could be out. She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Okay. Okay. I'll bet there's...Look at this.
See?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did? Mrs. Feur?
Maybe. Point is...not me.
Right. And why is she here? If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
She was lonely, I talked to her. Norman, I know how it looks, but
Claire, listen to me. I know you're under some strain. But there's no such thing as ghosts. They don't exist. Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dressed?
Dinner. With Stan and his new girl.
When?
What do you mean? Claire, we talked about it. You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Oh.
...since Caitlin. You don't remember this?
Tonight?
Yes, tonight. We're going to be
When you do this, I swear...
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
What are you doing?
Restaurant. Let them know we're running late.
Five minutes?
You're not at the center.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
We're going to be fine.
There we go.
Well, that's a relief.
I don't need a shrink.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Norman...
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years. If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said I wasn't upset. Of course I'm upset. I miss her terribly. But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
I never said...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middleaged woman cracking up.
Are you lonely?
No! And I don't need a psychiatrist!
What are you doing out here?
He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed her and
This is the Feur thing?
Yes. And he's going to get away with it.
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
Who did?
Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
How did you
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
What?
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
What are you...? No.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper. You know that. I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Sabotage?
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
The accident...?
But then you've been so much better...
Norman, this isn't about you. This is something that's happening to me. It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention. Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Sweetheart
No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Keep your voice down.
I will NOT.
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Claire, please...
I'm sorry...
Then where is she?
...I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for dinner. Sure you won't stay?
No, it's fine. I'm fine.
Really big bed.
Do I have everything?
Yep.
Call ya later.
What?
Are you glad? I'm glad.
You know I am.
Good. You sat in front...I saw you there...
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
You don't remember?
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
You dropped a glass.
I...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers. You started crying. I tried to comfort you...
In the living room...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio. I took you home.
But why? I can't understand how I could just completely
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving. It was a hard time.
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
I may have seen her on campus.
Not personally.
No. I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's her. This is the woman who I've seen.
The...
Yes. The ghost.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra
STOP IT!
I take it your not mad at me.
Wouldn't go that far.
Ow!
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
I don't like this, this...
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Who?
Your wife...
STOP IT!
"You know..."
What?
I was there.
Claire
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Oh God...
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened. And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't. Until now.
It was last year. We were having troubles.
So you fucked a student?!
That's not what I'm sayi
DON'T touch me. Just get away from me. Go!
Claire, please don't...
What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music...
I never asked you to quit!
...Oh BULLSHIT. You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
THAT'S NOT TRUE! You wanted to quit! And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
Who?
To Caitlin!!
Leave her out of this!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
Stop...
...would do anything just to be around me. And I slipped. God help me, I slipped.
I'm not going to listen to this.
I tried to break it off!
You should have tried harder.
Claire...
Get out of my way.
She was damaged and unstable. The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became. Finally, she showed up at the new house...
How did she know where it was?
She did it.
We don't know that for sure.
Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be?
We have to get out of here.
It's alright.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
She's gone.
What?
She can't be here without me.
How can you be sure?
I don't know, but I am. She was there and then she was gone. I felt it.
Claire...
The leaves...
Incredible. We should take a drive before they're gone. Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Look for antiques...
Yep. There's some great places nearby.
Adamant.
What?
Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming.
Huh.
Do you know it?
Don't think so.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
What's that for?
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
You don't have to do that.
I know.
Fine. I'll do the shopping.
She's out there isn't she? She's in the lake.
Okay. Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed!
I did NOT! I did not kill anyone. Jesus. Claire, listen to me. I walked in and she was lying there dead. I swear to you. On my life! She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me! To destroy us! If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have
I don't believe you.
IT'S TRUE. That's...you have to believe me! Oh God, I'm telling you the truth! I did what I had to, Claire. She was gone. There was nothing I could do for her. I did...I put her in the lake. I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink. And I've lived with that image ever since. I couldn't just stand there while everything my career, us, everything, just washed away. Don't you see, Claire? She's doing this! This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
What?
MADISON!
How you holding up?
Good. I'm good.
You are?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Well good. So you're human.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Wow. Got here just in time. I brought you this.
What is it?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody
It soothes heartache and promotes psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring
You're discussing me with your psychic?
She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
So you'll have some later. Notice anything...different?
Oh my god. You bought it.
Yep.
It's niiice.
Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Absolutely.
Listen, I've gotta run. I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
You got it.
You think he killed her?
I don't know. When you say it, it sounds crazy. But what else could it all be?
Know what I think?
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Please. That's all I need.
Someone's there.
What?
In the window. Norman's at work.
I don't...
Wow. I'm losing it.
No, you're not. But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Sit down here.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
This.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. What's her first name?
I don't know.
Nothing's happening.
Shhh.
Oh...
ME...
Mef? What's Mef?
It's initials. F is Feur. It's her.
I have to go.
Jody, wait.
Are you okay?
I think so
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
It's alright.
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.
Then what was it?
Nothing. It wasn't anything. I've been on edge lately. Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just
Something was there. You saw it.
Did I?
Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Hartford?
And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
No. Jody, listen to me. You have to listen to me. This is not something that I can do right now. Whatever it was, it's gone. I need it to be gone now.
But Claire
Please.
Okay. Okay.
I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call you.
Oh God...you knew.
I was down in Adamant...
Adamant?
Artsy little village down seven. There's a guy there who sells my work. I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse. She was young. I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Why?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Relieved?
I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
I got there first. Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman. He seemed desperate not to lose you. He promised to handle it. And we all let it drop away.
All of us.
I'm a terrible friend.
No.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection.
No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I know.
I can't believe this is happening.
We need help. Please let me call the medium.
That could take days. I need to do something now. Don't you see? She wants us dead.
Alight, alright. Stay calm. You opened this door. There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Like what?
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
What is it?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Did he say that?
Jody he was lying.
What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
I guess not.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
You've got a beautiful life. And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. I've come to think that's all that really matters.
I don't know...
Trust me, Claire. You hear something... change the subject. You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Wow.
This is...
We know each other.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
We were suite mates.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Oh God...
You should have heard her play.
Stop.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Do we have to?
And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
She's making this up.
I'm not. Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
She got it. Turned it down.
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Mrs. Frank?
Yeah.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
What's your name?
Claire.
She never mentioned you.
Just plain old coffee. None of that mocha nonsense.
It's fine.
You look a little old for a student.
I'm not. We...we met at a party.
Sounds about right. Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's. Sure didn't get it from me. They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young. Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
She never mentioned her father.
Well she wouldn't. He left when she was twelve. Never spoke about him after that.
Why are you here?
I don't know.
It's like that. Doesn't seem real. No note. Nothing. Cops say she'll be back. I just wanna know what happened.
Full scholarships. Princeton too. She wanted to stay close.
You must have been very proud.
They're calling me in to work.
I should be going anyway.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
Of course.
What was her major?
Biology. She wanted to be a doctor.
Who are you?
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer. From next door. Is everything
You're the flower lady.
Um...yes.
I've seen you. From the window.
Is everything alright?
Hello?
I'm not...
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Who? Your husband?
And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
What? What are you afraid of?
I can't, no, no, I can't...
Tell me. Please.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Tell me. I can help you.
How? How can you help me? With your flowers and your perfect life...
That's not...It's not like that.
I've never even met you.
I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
I'm sorry. It's for the flowers. Why don't you...
Oh God. He's back. I'm sorry. Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying. Please...
Wait! Don't go...
I wanted to apologize.
You do?
For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And then you weren't there.
Right. I'm sorry.
Would you like some iced tea?
Very much.
Your house is so beautiful.
Thank you.
And these roses. They're much prettier up close.
No.
Of what? What were you so afraid of?
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Love.
What?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe? That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Um...sure.
I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No. No, I don't.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends.
Yes?
Um...
I'm running late here. I just came back for my briefcase.
Right. Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood. I'm Claire Spencer. From next door.
This really isn't a good time.
Well maybe your wife...
She isn't here.
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
Ohkay...
I have to go.
Who?
Give me that shit. Your wife.
I didn't kill my wife.
Of course. You must be so proud.
I am.
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
How're you holding up?
Just fine. It's a lovely party.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
Almost.
Wonderful. It's good to see you two doing so well.
I'm sorry?
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Uhhuh. What can be?
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
For the Dupont Chair. I swear. I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
No. I'm just not sure what you mean.
There was just...some tension. You were upset. I remember being concerned.
At the party.
Toward the end. You remember?
Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Well, I'm glad. Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who's that?
The wives.
Who's idea was it?
Mine. His. We both...thought...
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
Your husband?
Yes. I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Do you really think so?
No.
Why is he worried?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and... Why is this so hard?
Fireball?
You're joking.
These are good.
Mmhmm.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
How do you know it's a she?
I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub.
What does she look like?
Pretty. She's a blond.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Fine.
What do you think I should do?
What?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think that'll help?
Can't hurt. And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Are you humoring me?
Nope.
How?
I don't know. My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
What's happening to me?
Well, that's what we're here for.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Yes, but...
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
Maybe. I don't know. I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive. Like somebody needed me. And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
She said, "You know." That I know.
Do you?
No.
What do you think? Guess.
I felt...pain. That she'd been hurt by someone. This is great. I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my
Have you been hurt?
Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
You were in an accident?
Last year. I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this... ...a minor concussion. But the car looked bad. It could have been bad. I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
What?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
That can't feel good.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it. My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "emptynest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm willing to deal with that. I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Do you have a scarf?
Hey.
Yes?
It's only two hours away.
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
Of course you will.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
That was very good.
Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Why?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
No, he wouldn't.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
That's not true.
Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is.
He loves you very much. He just
I know he does.
Are you mad at me?
Listen to me. The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
I miss you.
So much.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
A ghost?
Did you?
No. But once I heard...
What?
Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.
Then we both are.
Stop saying things so loud!
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
You guys are being real assholes
You bet. We all can't be such modern people
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not. I'll get the maid to write the essays
YES!
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Never fear, Tony is here. Ladies first.
Darling? I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night. Now you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Mom.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
They're all human beings
Servants. Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Oh really? We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When  you're a big boy. I mean you know it's bad for you
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE  BADLY
I'll think about it. Now run along darling.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton. This is Sir Wilfred.
Hi there Sarah
No thank you sir we're fine.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share. I love them
Well?
Well divide 18 into three
Six six and six
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Sell my soul?
Any student of Black Magic can do it. .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales. Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil. I think that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it. There's a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
Can this be stopped?
Maybe before the event, never after.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Safety in numbers man.
Right.
Anyone else not coming?
Right behind you.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them. They begin walking around the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman. They give each other looks of disgust and continue on. The next is of a Frankensteinesque creature carrying a woman in its arms. The four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim. MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it. On the staircase is a zombiefied creature. We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth. Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
This. is killer.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
Getting scared? Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
What? Tony and China, together?
Wooo. Jealously rearing its ugly head.
I'm not kidding. I want to get out of here  now, ok.
Then why do you still like her?
Like her? I don't know if I ever liked her. It's just you want what you can't get.
I know what you mean.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
I don't know. I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Come on.
No I'm serious. It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
No, no James, it's not like that. Tony and China, they're just friends.
That's not what you said last night.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
A little?
You aren't sick! We've got to get back. What are you doing!
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok. I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Oh that explains everything.
You don't understand. I recognized his face now come on.
Big deal!
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Who's is all this?
Well?
Well. .this, is Mr. Lincoln. And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
China
Sarah listen to me.
Go away.
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Uh yes, thank you. It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
They seemed, closing by much
Tony and China?
Vell. Goodnight.
Hello?
Hello, Mrs. Webster. Is China there?
No Jonathan.
No?
She went to a waxwork party
A party at a waxwork huh?
Can I give her a message?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Your books Master Loftmore
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff  excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
And uh, your nicotine sir
Thank you
Allow me sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Have a nice day sir
We're all here, and ready sir!
Jenkins!
Good evening sir.
Jenkins. Can I get you some help?
Too late for that sir. Give my love to the misses. Get those bastards!
Weird and tiny huh?
Hi
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Yes, I guess you're right
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Well that's for me to know  but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez. Can't even take a joke
Anybody want another drink?
It's eleven fortyfive let's go
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
About what? About us.
Us is over. You had your chance you blew it.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of, not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'. I'm looking for something just a little more in a man. A little `je nes se qua'.
A little what? CHINA See. You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Suffer? We're living in America.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Ok toots, I will.
Oh Mark. It's ok. It's ok.
China. What happened? CHINA Shhh. It's ok. I missed you so much.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
With Mark?
He still likes you
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob. He doesn't even know how to spell `lady' let alone treat me like one. You know the last time we went out he actually made me pay for a drink?
He did?
Yes, I'm sure. What I need is an older man, something with class, a little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Businessman?
Businessman!
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Yeah
So why are you dating Jonathan?
But?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
What's that?
A body. I mean we're talking major body
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent acrosstheboard wage cut.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here, you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pacmanned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
We'll take our chances. Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested. Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
You got it, G.G.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business. Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor. Interesting. You got a card?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
It's over you, Gordon.
You told him about us?
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding. I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
I can't...and I won't.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grownup package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions. I know what this guy is about greedhe's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present managementdedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drugyou boys might want to have a look at it.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Old values. Buy.
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing. Anacott Steel.
No such thing Bud  'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something? Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets. You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me  buy.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts  'cause it never does.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
How you doing Buddy?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
...how do you know? You wish...
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Oh Christ!
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Excuse me.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Oh really? Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this, you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although... I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery  too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that PreColumbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
I gather you're a decorator.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
What if I have a previous engagement?
Break it.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and... my first yuppie.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
So. See you Friday.
You really do believe in destiny?
Only if I want something bad enough.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
Yeah, almost...
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
And what do you want?
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
Well, why stop at that?
I don't.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
...isn't it perfect!
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
That's right  one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Do you think you're ready?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will  and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world. ...right here...make love to me...now... Stop me if I'm going too far.
I'll let you know.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius! Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word  a mover, shaker.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express... ... and you're going along for the ride.
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You really mean that? What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Get the hell out!
Hi.
Why?
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
Oh no, no...
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective  less than one visit to the doctor.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing  to do business with a man like you...
So what firm you with, pal?
Jackson, Steinem...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Chart breakout on this one here...uh WhitewoodYoung Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
A comer. 80 mediumbody jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
How do you know?
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
My home number's on the back...
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Hi sport.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
...I can't even see it...
...for my kid Rudy  3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
Mr. Gekko  thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Excuse me sir.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS  they like animals but they can't stand people!
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly... ...about 50 thousand.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
What? How do you know about my father?
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Yes...
Know the name?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport. ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world... Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I don't understand.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I... It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that? I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
What about hard work?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50100 million, a player Bud  or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it. ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
Allright. Wait here...
I guess I'll head back...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang"  Bud Fox.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
You're learning, sport...
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you  play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line. Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment. ...an old Russian proverb  "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
...Gordon.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wakeup call. Go to work.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
How much?
Close to two million. But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility... ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
Gordon what I wantand I never asked you for anythingis to be your copilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
What does that mean?
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
What makes you think you can?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen... So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
What the hell do you want?
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twentyfour years. I gave 'em my word.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation... Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Tell me, Gordonwhen does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
How much is enough Gordon?
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do  stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip. We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it... ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Obviously...
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
...I can't make it tonight.
Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Dump it.
Hello Bud.
Gordon.
You sandbagged me on Bluestar. I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
What was that?
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Okay.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Yeah, right...
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
So what's the problem?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
....Relax Roget You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
He never told me...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Didn't he tell you? That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
We are?
So, where are we going?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while. Work up an appetite.
Want some? Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8... Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
So you're hot on this stock?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
What'd you tell him?
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
You sure?
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And rememberyou don't know anything, nothing.
I don't know anything!
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
What are you doing here?
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigarsDavidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
...thanks Natalie.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone. ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Speak English will ya.
D.K.  didn't know  who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
Coulda been a contender.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top roomI gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never... ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
How's Mom?
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
...Work okay?
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
That's great Dad.
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
About what?
The FAA announcement.
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
What brings you out here...
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Don't start, alright.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month... What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much  and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
Whatever night you like.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
I met them before you were born.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
Your words, not mine...
You speak for me, son.
Another cup of coffee?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down. Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day  Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you. You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Hello, Natalie  guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
It concerns his future!
Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
...well, see him?
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
...gotta read my reports.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Marv, ...I just bagged the elephant!
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus. Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
What the hell...
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
What's going on?
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Hey the door was open.
Then get out and close it behind you.
You know what you need, buddy buddyan optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectumto change that shitty attitude of yours.
Get the hell out!
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Start unloading.
Sell?
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman slayer?
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...if I had your looks, better.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
...you take that Anacott Steel?
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
... That's what you told us to say.
Give me that phone. Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
He's lying.
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Please, no thanks...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Oh really.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Grand Marnier.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Tell those spineless toads we'll selfinsure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes... You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
They don't know what's going on!
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Sell it all. What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
....beautiful.
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...

I need a ruling on the Hats. I say a Leopardskin, and...
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks.... I think we're upandrunning...
What would be true, then.
Well, you said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
...as of today, 89% favorable.
Eighty<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
...by you?
By the media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
Well, there's a lot to be said for that. And I'm going to show a clip. You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times... But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more. With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
It's tough to rhyme.
I believe in you....
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
Surest thing you know.
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
Yeah, good good good good good. And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
I have the White House on the Line.
...one minute: Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
...the Suitcase Bomb. ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm." Okay, now: Good. Now, Alright. Act <u>TWO</u>... I need the following here. Right now: Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
Isn't Johnny Green in the...
No, he's back in Nashville.

She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop. They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
Better.
You like it?
Yes.
Fine. Good.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
Uh...uh... Mounties. The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
They look stupid.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket. You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
Shoes, Hats....
The special hats of the Special Antiterrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Black...
Leopard Skin...
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
It's a <u>beret</u>...

British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Thank God this is America.
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...? Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
Keep Talking....
What guards Us Against Canada...?

Where are we on the Image? Grace? <u>Grace</u>...
Headshots. Girls to play the girl in our footage. I like the sorrowful one. Anybody Else....?

Too Texan. Go with the stick. Thanks. <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
Bunny: I had an idea: a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>... Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>. What I'm wondering: what do we <u>call</u> it... You got my number...
Why are they ...
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
The Canada Thing was a shuck. A <u>shuck</u>  wasted a day. What can you do with Canada? Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar onSnow." Lays there on the plate like a lox.
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ... He is Left Behind. He is discarded like an Old Shoe... Gemme the Pentagon. List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind. Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"...

Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry. Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann? <u>Schuster</u>... uh
All part of the Service we Render.
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
When do you bring'em back? Schumann.
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
Don't tune it too good.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
William Schuman. Old Shoe. U.S. Army. Serial number, 21312841262.
Take ten.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
It's too clean.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit. This may take a while.
Do I know you?
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
What one has to do, Mr. Moss. Is to fight a holding action.
...holding action. THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
If we can hold the breakinthedam for ten days, til the election, we...
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam. How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
What do you want the kid to say?
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
String a few together. All I need's eleven,
How you going to stretch it? This won't hold for eleven days. Guy fucked a twelve yearold...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
What do you think would hold it off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh... You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business. Why come to me?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Here's the Short Course: FiftyFour, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Uh, it's a slogan. From, uh...
Remember the Maine...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
...uh ... No, that's...
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>. Y'know why. Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here. Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten the war. Gulf War? Smart Bomb, falling through the roof. 2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb. The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you? War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss. That's why I'm here.
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss. The Things in Trouble. Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing. You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>. But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing.
Why Albania?
Why not?
Who?
The...
"They Got To Know?" <u>Stan</u>...? Get with it. Who Killed Kennedy...? I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>. You watched the Gulf War. What did you see? Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
Is that true?
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know. You take my point?
...going to War...
It's not "war." It is a <u>Pageant</u>. It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
I never won an Oscar.
N'it's a crying shame. But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Yes. Indeed I did.
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script. You're a <u>director</u>... But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do? What did you do? All you've got is the <u>credit</u>... Some plaque on the wall...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>... "It's a pageant"
...that's what it is.
"The Country Is At War."
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks.
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha. <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
They got to have something that we want.
I'm sure they do.
What do we have that they want?
"Freedom."
Why would they want that?
...who is this guy...?
Act Two: and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
And get me the Fad King. No. Get him First... We don't need an Act Two?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
...it's a Teaser!
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
You can't have a war without an enemy.
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>... How long do I need him for?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war... We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
Ten Days. There going to be any Back End in this thing?
W...what?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
Lots n lotsa cash. Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger backend than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Threeothree...
The men and women of Detachment ThreeOThree, with their...
What is it?
President's speech.
At the Airport? Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
What?
The War is Over. Senator Nole just ended the War.
The War ain't over.
I saw it on TV.
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over. This is <u>my</u> picture. You think you're in a <u>spot</u>? You think this is a tight spot? Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography. This is... this is... this is just... Act One: THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Yeah...?
"Good Old Shoe  " We put him in a sweater.
He can't respond to the Allegations. I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>. Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the LeopardSkin <u>Hats</u>? Here's my idea....
I think it's fine?
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
No, it's... I'll, yes, I'm holding, but... No, it's ...
In the Folk Music Section.
In the Folk Music Section. We'll be in in...
...this the Guy.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Where is he now?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now. Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What?
What do you mean he won't do it? He won't do <u>what</u>? He won't do the sp... It's what? It's <u>corny</u>? <u>Corny</u>? Is that the word? Of <u>course</u> it's corny. We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny. Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech. NO We're, Are You Listening? LOCKED IN. We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it  it's the setup for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech. Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...
Not bad for government work. Having a good time.
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Mmm...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Mmm.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit. Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
...that's right.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
All the greater accomplishment.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
I've come to feel It's my thing. You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job. And then...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
...<u>isn't</u> it? Hey, whatthehey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of  help me out here  and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties. His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service. Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural. Nine A.M...? Nine? Miss the commuters, but...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars. I'm slowing down... No, no. Look, lookit: I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why: you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>. Because Schumann's the Shark. He's ...<u>Jaws</u>. You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie... Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President... No, no, put him on. Put him on. President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Big mistake.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now. No. Lookit: it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance? Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain. Make them pay for him. Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is. Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks. Labor, five bucks an hour. If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour. If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Hey, lcokit: <u>any</u> business...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
What am <u>I</u> gonna do? I'm gonna "Fade Away." What are you gonna do?
Well, I'll be damned if I <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ... You know what the worst word is, in the English Language? It's retirement." What the <u>hell</u> was I thinking of? Hell, I used to...
We pick up Schumann. Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming. Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
I got it in the inaugural. "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly: Thank you for <u>voting</u>...
Getting off on the inaugural? Gonna go...

Bigger than that. For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
You've <u>got</u> something, there...
...a masterpiece...
...givem what they want...But...
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport. I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Uh...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Yeah, well  it's only one word difference.
A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.

Wake up.

Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
I'm tired.

You can't tell this story.
Why not?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
Ha ha. No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
No, I'm On Top of it...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
No, I'm fine... I got it together....

Hell of a show. Hell of a job, Stan.
...one more day.
Naw, naw, we own the airways...
You see? What's the lesson here? <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
No. You're right.
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron. Want to thank you.
What're you doing?
I'm looking for a phone...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Watch me.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Watch me.
Stanley. Stanley... you knew the... Stanley. You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
Deal's changed.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed. The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it? Money? <u>Money</u>? You want Money?
<u>Money</u>? You think I did this for money...? I did this for <u>Credit</u>. <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>? Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
China.
When's he coming back...?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Alright, now, here: he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
Trade Re1ations.
You're goddamn right. And it's got nothing to do with the B2 Bomber.
There <u>is</u> no B2 Bomber,
That's what I'm telling you. The two things: the two things: Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed. And the B2 Bomber... Clear me a space. Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
How much...?
And, to hold it together, I need two days. There <u>is</u> no B2 Bomber: here's what you do ahout that: whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B2 Program..." "What B2 Program, and why should it screw it up?" "If the president moves to deploy the B2 before it is fully tested." "Deploy the B2, <u>Why</u>?" "In the Crisis."
It can be documented that he displayed the...
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month. One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust. The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
...why?
...you the Press Office?
...Yes.
Earn your money. ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
...Good...
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Is there a press conference today?
What do <u>you</u> think? What I need from you: I need a base of operations. Some place in the District. I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
But there isn't a B2 bomber.
Where'd you go to school, Kid. Wellesly?
Dartmouth
Then show a little spunk. There <u>Is</u> no B2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
Course there's a war. I'm watching it on Television.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Who're you working for?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
What <u>are</u> you interested in?
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents. But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick. And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same. Your country and your job.
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean. That's what you see me doing here. What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
What's on your mind?
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that?
I have.
Well, I have, too. Would you do it <u>again</u>...? In't that why you're here? I guess <u>so</u>. N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against? Your "ability to fight a Twoocean War" against who? Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against? That time has <u>passed</u>. It's <u>passed</u>. It's <u>over</u>. The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>. It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>. You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall. N'you're gonna be out in the street. And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you: you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life," well, Chuck, <u>this</u> is your way of life. Innit? And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting. And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Could if we had to. Rather not. Rough weather.
We're due at Andrews.
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Captain... You wanna Take'er up...?
Heavy weather East of here.
Whaddaya think?
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
I gotta get something, I gotta get ...shoes? Ties? Hats...? Good. Good.
...what is this?
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania? Because, lookit: I can get my hands on a lot of walkingaroundcash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tiein here: <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad. A "Shoefad"... Here's what it offers us...
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Hello...?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Where is he?
Out in Oklahoma.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
...we own it?
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron? You think about it. <u>This</u> is the meeting. This, here. Schumann and us. King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS. THE STILL BAND. A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
How's our friend? What is he, "dead?"
This is nothing. ...piece of cake. Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior. They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD. IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.

ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
Shoe, boy...? You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans? Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled. We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not. That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
From whence did it come? Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents. Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued. Now: How did we come by this information? And. Who subdued that group?
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT. SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>. To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, ThreeOhThree...
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines.
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%. A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
Dashes and Dots. And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..." And he got the message through. "Courage. Mom..." Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage." I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn. I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe." Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...

...where is my pill?
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
Oh, MiGod.
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
I was acting as a Private Citizen. Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with. Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
Quite touching.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
Guess what? We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border. There are no nuclear devices in Albania. Z'at put us in something of a pickle? Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity. Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland. The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border. The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening. There is no War.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill served by any, any...any...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
And I think that the Security of the Country would be bestserved by its citizens obeying its laws. Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme searchwarrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and benchwarrants for the two of...
Who we got here...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Alright. Look here, any of you kids hear in this room: what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it. Tell'em what they need to know.
When it broke, he said one word: get me Ronnie Brean.
Well. Alright. What is it? What's, he, uh...? He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...? What's the thing? You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Three minutes. It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
Okay. And she's alleging...?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What difference does it make if it's true? It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it  How long've we got til it breaks?
Front page. Washington Post. Tomorrow.
Well, yeah. Now. That's not good. <u>Okay</u>: <u>Okay</u>. We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
When do we bring'em back?
You gotta give me a day. I need a day. He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>. Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is. We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin. He's got some rare strain of...
It won't hold.
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie 
Yes  It will... Now: why is the President in China?
We're going to have to explain away the...
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout. Side effects of a pill ain't gone trump that. You have to keep'em guessing for Two weeks. You don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
What crisis?
I'm working on it. Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...? All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
<u>Do</u> it...
And you?
It won't hold.
One day, Two days? <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
We don't need it to prove out. We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What would do that...?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'm working on it.
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
I'll be back within the hour. Now,
It's going to be fine. It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
What is it?
It's the roughcut, the other side's new commercial.
Twenty thousand dollars.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
Gemme a plane. Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago. O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
I'll see you at National.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
Tell me again.
Lookit, don't worry about it. It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
We aren't going to have a war. We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost?
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Who would find out?
...the...
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
What did they find out about the Gulf War? One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...you want us to go to War...
...that's the general idea.
Why?
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...? Also: they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B2 <u>Bomber</u>...
...they sound what?
<u>Shifty</u>. Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject. You wanna change this subject, you better have a War. What do you need? It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>. Okay? What do you need in an enemy? Somebody you fear. Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
<u>Who</u>?
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Yes.
Why?
What do you know about them?
...<u>nothing</u>...
Precisely.
What did Albania ever do to us?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...? You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B2 Bomber.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Here's what you got to do: Get your Press Office, Right now. To deny; There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity. They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
...where is the Back End coming from?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
The hostages, but that was a naturallyoccuring... It was a putup job? But where was the, where was the money in that?
In the yellow ribbon.

But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
How do we explain that? Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>. You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.

You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Lure</u> him.
What are you saying...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor. Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing. Okay; <u>Now</u>: Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that. But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight. The 303 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
...on the way in.
When you... What? I'm busy.
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>. What?

For Schumann.
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent. We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you. ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Where's John?
Performing solo. Enjoying the concert so far?
The symphony of collision...
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison. You know, we have so much in common we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.
You and me have nothing in common.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
Why's that?
What C4...was Cox talking about?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Where did you plant the C4?!
What C4...was Cox talking about?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Where did you plant the C4?!
You can't die until you tell me where the C4 is. Where is it?!
My...secret.
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
There you go best seat in the house.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
Aren't you going to watch with me?
I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
Thankyou, Daryl. You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
What are you talking about?
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now. Beam me up, Scotty!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You actually listen to all those tapes?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you. How you feeling today?
A little less than yesterday.
In other words, par for the course. How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
John died.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing. If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
That's not true, Parker.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Go to hell.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it? But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Enough!
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
I don't need a babysitter.
What you need is a collar.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive. Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
It wasn't a lie.
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
You all right?
Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar.
You ready for this?
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better to improve upon what was already done.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him. Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done. The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
I know who would know.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
What happened when he was 17?
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers. Stay here.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Do me one favor if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
What are you doing?
Checking my pulse. It's elevated. You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
I'm still working on it.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I've been in prison, remember?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I am impressed.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Who said that?
Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory. We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonofabitch before he kills anybody else.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Give me your wrist.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
And I'm going to make sure of it. Give me your wrist.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
How did you get your hand out?
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
She's beautiful, you know?
Thankyou. Her name is Karin.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
What does that mean?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does. Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well. Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Don't worry about it, all right?
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Relax. I know what you meant.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Don't get out of the car.
Stop me.
What the hell's going on?!
This is my area of expertise.
What did you do to those people?
Nothing.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Enjoying yourself?
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Tell him.
What's the problem?
I'm doing the best I can!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Start of what?
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing. Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences. Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
You like baseball?
Real effective security...
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Authority still makes me nervous.
Which way?
Both.
Parker  stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was. Get a hold of yourself!
We know you didn't kill those guards.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
He didn't know about the neural toxin. I did.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
How did you find out about the toxin?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
You're not capable of it.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Part of him is.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...
See something?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Nice work.
Thanks.
Find out anything?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Can I ask you something?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go right now. Why are you going to do this?
You don't know?
That's why I'm asking.
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not. And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
You okay?
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
My guess is dead.
Sid?
I don't know.
Where the hell are you going?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
How's your pulse?
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
Duck!
What do we do now?
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
Did you recognize the sonofa bitch who got away?
Should I have?
Think hard  it'll come to you...
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
It was me, what?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you? You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a tripletwisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
My God...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you? In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I had something a little different in mind. Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
All my work is my finest.
You catching my drift?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
SID NO!!!
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
Of course you are.
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
Help me get out of here.
Glad to...
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived. What do you think I'm doing?
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
What's wrong with Parker?
How should I know?
Show me his physical sensory level.
I wonder how that...
Turn it down!
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
Talk so I can understand.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Then fix it.
HEY!!!
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard... Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
You're...such a wimp.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
It feels so.. .real.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs... It's a physiological machine.
This is supposed to be years away.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
How do you kill it?
Separate the character module from the neural net...
... and you get nanodeath. Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I know. I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
You need a maid.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country. Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training  only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
I'm still making adjustments...
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer. ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
I'M WHAT?!
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
I understand... I understand perfectly.
How does he know who I am?
He hears...everything.
As a matter of fact, I do.
What did Cox pull him out early for?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Don't remind me.
What the hell happened?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform. I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Neither will the public. The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
Think you can do it?
Not from in here.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
What happens if I can't catch him?
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
How do you know I won't run?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
What did you find out?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter. Did you find out where the bomb is?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target. How much C4 is missing?
Enough to level an entire city block.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates. Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
This better not be a wild goose chase.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
What's the assignment?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off  you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in... I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach. Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
I should have told him.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either. So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
You think he's smart?
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is. But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I think we both know who did. What's so urgent?
I need your help
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
I don't set policy. You have the key?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Got it.
You all right?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you. You may not believe this, Parker,
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game. Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first. New scar you making it okay in there?
I'm getting by.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What about them?
Do me a favor keep sending them.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
I've seen worse.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist. LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Jesus Christ. Can you kill it?
If you can catch him.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Fine you want to stay here?
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted. So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Where's my gun?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
Then I guess we're even.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
On my life, I promise you I will.
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Why wasn't I told?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
Whatever.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
Catch him and your record's clean.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one. We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
But only you will know he's not human.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?
I don't know.
I wish we could hear them.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You already have staked your reputation. Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too. Bennett's ReElection Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose. The failsafe online, yet?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
In English, please.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you. ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
You sonofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
Me? What did I do?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know... The harm done to the music students who used the device it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Jesus Christ. I know who the dominant personality is. Lindenmeyer.
Hello.
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Today, a good girl.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
What?
Yes, yes, I saw you!
How did you see me?
From the terrace.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
No, I don't want to.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
How do you feel?
I have a headache.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
What happened to me?
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Have I slept long?
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Right, let's go. And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
What about you, Manuel?
I'm only good at making people laugh.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
She looks like a sick marrow!
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Ask the priest, miss.
That's enough. Go join the others, and don't come back here. And you'll have to control your temper.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
When you are, miss.
Good, then let's go!
Don't talk like that!
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
I've had a gutful of this.
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little selfcontrol, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Mother?
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
All right, Mother.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Mother.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
I had so many things to think about!
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Forgive me if I have offended you.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
What's going on, Moncho?
This louse is looking for trouble.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way! You stay here.
But, miss ...
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Yes!
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
Why are you crying?
I'm afraid.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
A black bull!
It's a very big one.
Very, very?
Yes  very, very big!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
He came in through the cupboard.
You little liar! Get out of here!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Where?
Come with me.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
How are you today?
Things seem to be getting better.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Are your parents alive?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
Stop this!
He's lying through his ass!
It's for people!
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
How much do you want for him?
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
What's he called?
Canelo!
Miss Viridiana ...
Are you Jorge?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Well... is it so urgent?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
What do you know about me?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Leave him alone.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Are they going to work here too?
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
I'll be ready.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Yes. Why?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
And ...your friend?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
No.
Why?
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
Why did he kill himself?
I don't know, sir.
One shouldn't be alone the whole time. I'm not like him, am I?
And this chest?
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Why?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
I don't know  they've always been there.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
Me, rich? Come on!
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
Where's the dough?
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
Kill him.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Why the bad temper?
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
She's mad.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
So, Ramona!
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
If you wake first, wake me up.
What are you going to do?
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
You're happy, aren't you!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
What are you thinking about?
That your cousin is more to your taste.
She isn't my cousin.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
How in hell does it wind up?
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
You see how much you like her?
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Me?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
It's very good.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
My God, what have you done to him!
He was asking for it.
But why? Why?
Ramona! Ramona!
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
Good.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
And in the vegetable plot?
That's good land.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock. Okay, let's get a move on! When are you leaving?
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
What will the lady say?
She won't even know.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Is it all right?
Yes.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
What's the matter?
Sit down, woman, sit down. You like me, don't you?
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days. You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
You believe me, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
How long are you staying?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
You have no feelings toward ...
No.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Come down here, you scamp.
Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Come down.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You see, even the voice.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Only because you want it.
What do you mean?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How did you know about that?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Yes, it is.
Don't you ever see him?
Never.
How could anybody behave like that?
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
Evil.
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
And this innocent child.
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
You must think I am a monster.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
Thank you, Uncle.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Whatever you like.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
You must think I'm mad.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Wasn't that cowardice?
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Unfortunately ...
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Maybe ...
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days  now you've spoiled it all.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Don't go!
You're lying.
No, it's true. Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Go away! Leave me alone.
Let me pass!
You must listen to me before you go.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this. Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Then you won't forgive me?
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Two.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Then it's a respectable house.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
Don Amalio!
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
They're playing games behind the couch ...
Which couch?
That one.
Take me there.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
I'll come to you tonight.
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
You'd like me to kill them?
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Yes, yes.
Stop this, stop this.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Where's the camera?
It's a present from my parents.
Good times.
Drum banging real times.
She's dead.
It was an accident!
Fucking desert.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man. Desert.
Right.
That's right.
Shut up Micheal.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
Take your time. I wish I had.
We will.
So where to on the honeymoon?
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
That's our plan.
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
...embarrassing, shameful...
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, apelike state...
The stone age.
The postVegas Man.
A mutant species.
Okay boys, smile!
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
Okay great. What will that be?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
What song?
"You Send Me."
Oh I know that. How does it go...
You know, Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me. Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
I do.
That ought to be about the end of that.
Yup.
No...No.
How do you know she's dead.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins selfhelp thing...you're all fuckedup in the head.
I got to agree with that.
The first day.
What?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
Did she believe you?
I have no idea.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
A move?
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Where's Boyd?
Downstairs in the closet.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
My God...
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
Did he try to kiss you?
All week long.
You alright?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I guess.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot  "Pup Corn."
Pup corn?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
There.
Where?
Yeah?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
That's a good one.
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
That's what I'm thinking.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
Yup.
That's just insecurity.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
About what?
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9. I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, asspuckering rage in these soulless lizards.
I just want her to be happy.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button... Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes... Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343. Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candycoat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
I'm not breathing right.
You're not breathing right?
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
I don't care for him.
He's your brother.
So?
I'll take a ride.
Go for it.
Come on.
I'm getting married...
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Where did you get that?
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Buzzing?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
I don't hear it.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Have another drink.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
The wahoo?
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
The wahoo moment?
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I think so.
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it? You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
What is it?
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing. I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
You did all right dad.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ballbuster I am.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Just kills me...
I love you dad.
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey. And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out. You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Everything okay?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
This is ridiculous.
Government cutbacks.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
We missed the deadline.
Can't we do it on the phone?
I don't think so.
Why is this Kid staring at me?
I'm not sure.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
I think so.
What do you mean, you think so?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
The wedding cake check?
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
Yes.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why what?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
How could I know what else I forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Don't you dare.
What?
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
Stop it. I'm sorry.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Are we going to do this again?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I wouldn't know.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
Well it's bad timing.
How do you figure?
Right before the wedding?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He is.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to reevaluate some of your friendships...
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He's weird.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You expect more what?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Time out.
It's vile!
That's absurd.
I've seen it on television.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask? Is that to much to ask!?!
You will not be common!!!
Do you love me?
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
Kiss me...?
We've got problems here.
Problems?
Seating problems.
Okay.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're supposed to have goldtrimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Do you love me?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Take care of those chairs.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Maybe.
Will you please call the chair people?
I will.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
I love you.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi. Are you calling from jail?
Not yet.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
I'm working on it, I've made three calls. I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
That's sweet.
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hello.
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
How late?
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
Okay.
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
What's the word on the chairs?
I'm working on it.
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
This is our honeymoon.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Well, can you come back inside?
Yeah. Sure.
Now?
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Are they fighting?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.
Can we just talk this out?
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are nonrefundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
We're not canceling.
I know.
I won't even discuss it.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.
Okay. Okay.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
No.
Yes.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
What?
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
What are you talking about?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
It's too late.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
But...
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
But...
No buts. I've waited twentyseven years, twentyseven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
What money?
He kept saying he was protected.
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Like how?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
The only proof is those bodies.
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
Move the bodies?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of... ...I just love you so much...So much...
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
What?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
No...
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
But...
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words  singing or anything?
Are we supposed to?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
May we have the rings please?
What?
The rings?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
I do.
You're a fucking moron.
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell I did!
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I never heard that.
Nope.
Moore?
Your ideas never work out.
Oh really? Starbucks?
I don't hate women.
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
You have a King fantasy.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
And what happens when you can't?
New king.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Israel doesn't have a King.
Then what do they have?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
What's your point?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
There's my point exactly.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
What?
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
They need leadership.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike  the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious selfexploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Not really, no.
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
You said nobody would miss her.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
You will not screw this up.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Ball park sausages.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America. Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Easy Micheal.
He must take an openfield run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
We're goosed.
We're not goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Micheal get a grip. What did you tell her?
Stop it!
Goosed!
Stop.
Goosed!
Give me the Valium.
Okay Micheal, let's go. Upsy daisy big guy.
How about my Fatburger?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me. You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
I love you.
You said that Boyd.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Who's up for making some real money?
Not really. Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Prison Communication Systems. An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
We need padded chairs.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
I can't.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
No.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Call 911.
Shut up.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens? They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal... Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Nobody knows.
Oh God. This is insane.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
Good God...Good God...
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
I'm calling the police.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat  It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
Go ahead.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you... ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, flyboy buttfucker.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
You always were a jealous man.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's having a problem here.
Easy Boyd.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
What?
What is the question you asked me?
I said, what have we done?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What's your point?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing  absolutely nothing  supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Regarding what?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Suck my ass.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't know...
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
What does that mean?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Now?
That's right.
Isn't it a little late?
Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
You're sick.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Not a prayer.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You need help.
No I don't.
Fish?
Your investment ideas never work out.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
I don't think so Boyd.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
But not tonight.
Not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Left side.
He's right.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
I got her arm.
Here's his head.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
I'm not talking to you?
What's goosed?
What is her disposition?
He just had two.
Give me two more.
He's too drunk.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go. You guys stay here.
What is it?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
What?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
She's not here.
Where is she?
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Okay. Hi.
So who's the lucky guy?
Who?
The groom?
Yup.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
That's right.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day. Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's still working?
That's right.
Sweet deal.
Is everything okay?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
She's in there!
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
What are you talking about?
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Lois please.
My god.
There's more.
Money?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
What does that mean?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but rescheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void. Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
Well, oh...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So where's that leave us?
So. When is the wedding.
Tomorrow. We are getting married tomorrow.
We'll be ready Adam.
I know you'll be. Three hours.
That's one idea.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Real times.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said... Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Are you solid with that?
No. I think it's fucked.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
The bucks gonna stop right here. If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I know and I'm honored...
If anything ever happens to me...
I know...
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
What happened? Oh my God...
No way.
It has to be done.
I want you to hear me out.
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I don't think so.
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Have you thought about what I said?
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
I got you.
Where's the bathroom?
Don't snap at them!
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Later.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
There is no candy!
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn MiniMart?!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Don't even start.
You want to hear me out?
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? Prison Communications.
More.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
She's got no fucking pulse.
You don't know what you're doing.
Wait!
What?
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Calling the ambulance.
Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
We have to call the ambulance.
Why?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Are you sure this was an accident?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Stop it!
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Bury her out in the desert.
Sure, why not.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
Her fucking head was caved in.
So I didn't fucking do it!
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What about the blood?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Have you ever done this before?
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
Sun rises at 5:52.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
How do you figure?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
So that's what we're doing.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
That is absolutely not true.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Watch the tone fella.
Fuck you Boyd!
Any time fat boy!
What is your problem?
I can't do this.
What?
At the seveneleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I don't give a damn.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
Adam! Calm down.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
It has worked.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
They won't figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
First of all...
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Sorry Fish.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
You're an asshole Adam.
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
I don't have to...
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Franco motherfucking Harris!
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
She's dead.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Playing?
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why was the floor wet?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
Why?!
Why?
It's sacrilegious.
This is pathetic.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell you do.
The hell I don't.
You have acquaintances  business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
What are you fucking talking about?
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Eat my ass!
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You're a loser.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
You fucking bastard!
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Don't you fucking threaten me  I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
You go home!
How ya doing?
What?
What's that?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
The stripper's here.
Excellent.
She's fucking hot!
I need a drink.
Jesus.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
Can't do what?
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
But you said grey, sir.
Not tweed  it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
She'll be out in a moment.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get 
Yes! That's it!
I thought so!
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size. All right, dear. We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
How soon can it be altered?
Well...
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black  short  long sleeves  with a neck cut this... ...and the skirt out.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By whom?
By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man. It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young. And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives! Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
She died.
How?
By her own hand. There are many such stories.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Ow!!
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No threeway stretch? How very un chic.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style. Ah, tomorrow!
What's tomorrow?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window. I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please! And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
I had to quit, Midge.
Why?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It wasn't your fault.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained 
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
It's where you belong.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Ah, JohnnyO...
Well?... what'll you do?
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
I'm having one now.
From that music.
Oh!
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
I've never run across one like that.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Uhhuh!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
What a pleasant hobby.
How's your love life, Midge?
That's following a train of thought.
Well?
Normal.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, JohnnyO.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back. It's a Mission number.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.
Sorry, old man. Work.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
What.
My... the acrophobia.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
I think I can lick it.
How?
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
That!?!
What do you want me to start with  the Golden Gate Bridge?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Step number two.
Okay.
Easy, now.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up 
Johnny!
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it 
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes. None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" 
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Oh! You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco! The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Yeah.
Pop Leibel.
Who?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
The poor thing....
And she died...
Now then, JohnnyO; pay me.
For what?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Nothing to tell.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I'll take you home.
Here you are.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Out!
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife? Ah, Johnny! Come on!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Think? Well, what do you think?
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Midge!
Byebye!
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Just wander.
Where?
Around.
Oh?
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
Oh?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Naturally.
What have you been doing?
Wandering.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What is it, a still life?
No, not exactly. Want to see?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Oh?
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask 
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Please answer my question.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face 
What is her name?
Valdes. Miss Valdes. It's Spanish, you know.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign. But sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered 
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Would you please go and look?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
Her car is gone.
What car?
Why am I here? What happened?
You... ...fell into the Bay.
You don't remember.
No...
Do you remember where you were?
Oh, of course I remember that! But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where were you?
At...
...Old Port Point! Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Why?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset. Ah... thank you for the fire.
Where had you been before?
When?
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
Before? Where? Where had you been?
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Wandering about.
You like it, too.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
No.
When you... There were pins in my hair...
Oh! Yes! Here!
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
I... didn't know where you lived.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
No, you are right, I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you... Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
My name is John Ferguson.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
I prefer John. There, that's done. And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
What?
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects. But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it? What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind... It's a formal thankyou letter. And a great big apology.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Not at all, I enjoyed 
 talking to you...
I enjoyed talking to you.
Would you like some coffee?
No! No, thank you!
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
I hope we will, too.
What?
Meet again, sometime.
We have.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I don't know.
Shopping?
No.
Well... anywhere in particular?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah. That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Do you know where you're going?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer! I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
How can you be sure?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
How old?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
The oldest living things?
What are you thinking?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever living.
I don't like them.
Why?
Knowing I have to die...
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
No.
Would you like a drink of water?
No, thank you.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Madeleine!
Where are you now?
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
Yes...
When?
Where were you born?
Long ago...
Where?
No!... No!
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No, don't ask me!
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
Why did you jump?
No!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
No, I can't tell you!
What?!
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Take me away from here?
Home?
...somewhere in the light.
I'm responsible for you now, you know. The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die. But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
Yesterday.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Vaguely...
What do you remember?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Would you know the room?
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
Where?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
How do you know?
I know.
There's a name on the gravestone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
What else?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
No!
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
And so explain it away? But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
I'm here, I've got you...
I'm so afraid... ...you won't let it happen...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
All the time.
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Why? What's happened?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
No, don't go away!
Only this far.
Where's your husband?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes 
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Tell me.
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Go on.
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner 
 and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... lowceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Yes?! But 
It's all there. It's no dream.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
No, never!
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Here with you.
And it's a all real.
Yes.
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it. Madeleine, think of when you were here!
My love... because I love you.
I love you too... too late... too late...
No... we're together...
Too late... there's something I must do...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
You can't.
Why?
Let me go.
Where?
To the church, I must go there.
Madeleine 
Please let me go.
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine 
Let me go! Let me go!!
Madeleine!!
You believe that I love you?
Yes.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
I won't lose you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Why?
Please. Because I love you. He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her. And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and 
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and 
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought 
0h, I thought so! A pickup! Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
Just let me talk to you.
What about?
You.
Why?
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked. Huh!
You're not far wrong.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Let me come in.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
You won't have to.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
What do you want to know?
Your name. And 
Judy Barton.
Who you are 
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's 
 and how you happen to be living here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
But you haven't lived here long.
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I told you! Right here!
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Salina, Kansas!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
I want to know who you are.
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Will you have dinner with me?
Why?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I remind you of her?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before. Okay.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
Mmm.
Okay.
Thank you again. Goodnight.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well 
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow m  but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Don't go.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No.
No? Then what?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Yes.
Why? Because I remind you of someone? That's not very complimentary. And nothing would... happen...
No.
That's not very complimentary, either.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Why?!
Please! And don't look at me.
Will you, Judy?
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
I like that one.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Yes 
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
Honest?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I want to! Come on!
But I like that one, Scottie.
No, it's not right.
Scottie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one   is beautiful.
They're none of them right.
But why?
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy 
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but 
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
I don't like it!
We'll take it! Will it fit?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You can.
No, you wouldn't let me. And I don't want to go...
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
You don't even want to touch me.
Yes. Yes, I do.
The color of your hair...
Ah, no!
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Yes.
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Well?
It should be back from your face  with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Wherever you'd like...
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Mmmm.
Is that the best you can do?
Come here.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Too late. I've got my face on.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
No, Ernie's is fine.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks. And... let's see... to start...
I've got it. He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
All in good time.
Scottie!
How does it work?
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. There.
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
Where are you going?
To complete my cure.
Scottie, why are we here?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
But why? Why here?
Madeleine died here.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
I need you.
Why?
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
I'm scared.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you 
Scottie 
 and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you." But I did.
And I couldn't follow her. God knows I tried. One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Take me away...
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
No!
Go up the stairs, Judy. I'll follow.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
You can't. You're afraid!
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Scottie, please...!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Yes!
And she was the one who died. Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Took no chances, did he? And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it 
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Yes!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Your accident...
Ah, yes! I was a setup. I was the madetoorder witness. Where is he now?
I don't know... Switzerland?
We'll find him.
I made it.
What are you going to do?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power... he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Some money.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
What are you going to do?
I loved you, Madeleine.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you! Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Love me... keep me safe...
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Hello.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
What happened?
She... went into the Bay.
Hello?
Did she hurt herself?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I married into it.
Interesting business.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
You don't have to do it for a living.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East  Baltimore  so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
And you like it.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
Like all this.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power... the freedom.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No, I'm all right.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers. And you've quit the force. A permanent physical disability?
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the TopoftheMark. But   there are plenty of streetlevel bars In this town.
Would you like a drink now?
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits. Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective  and you're in the shipbuilding business. What's on your mind, Gavin?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
Someone dead.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hardheaded Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
No.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
How often does this happen?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Where'd she go?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to... Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
Well?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go? I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care. Scottie 
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys 
I want you.
It's not my line.
Scottie, I need a friend! Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
How can I see her, to know her?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first. Which is easier?
Ernie's.
All right. You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But you knew about this.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too oldfashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Greatgrandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death  was Madeleine's grandmother.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
But she doesn't know, about her background. She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
She is not my wife.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine. Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
I  I 
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back. Goodbye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
He won't talk.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
How'm I doing so far?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Should I?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Yes.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy. Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
The Big Boy did...?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him ' Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Huh.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over. Jimmy, gimme another drink. How are you?
Me, too.
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail. P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years. You like that story?
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop... ...fourandonehalf minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We, we were rather busy...
Fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes. We were trying to restore her...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.
Huh. And why is that?
Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
Another, Frank . . . ?
...everybody. Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' `That's correct.' Mike says, `Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...' Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
I want to buy you a drink.
Thanks, Franky.
Well, well, well. Huh?
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
That's for sure, Frank.
Hi.
Hi. How are you doing?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
You live in the neighborhood?
Uhhuh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
How old is he?
Four. You're great with these kids.
Thank you.
You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
I used to be a nurse.
That's a wonderful profession. My daughterinlaw's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Kathy Price...
Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventysix, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
Yes.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
A single hour.
Yes.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
You saw Kat in New York... ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's locked.
It's locked?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case. A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I'm sure you do ...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I know. I went ...
... You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
... fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
... I understand ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue ...
... I understand ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
What does it mean? I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To crossexamine... to... to...
Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Yes.
Hi, Mickey ...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...? What's going on here ...?
Uh ...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... now who is that ...?
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
... I get these people to trust you they're coming here tomorrow by the way I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork  and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
Are you out of your mind...?
...I'm going to need your help...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down twohundred ten grand? Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
I'm going to help her.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop  we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
What?
You  Listen: you said to me, `if not now, when...'
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court  is this getting to you...? You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...he's a good man...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well  they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
...I have to stand up for her...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will you help me...? Will you help me...?
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Admittance form is wrong.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrubnurse...'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'
They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
No.
'Mary Rooney, fortynine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Right.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Been a long time, huh...?
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
So what?
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
They still have to take it to a jury.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
John: gimme a cuestaray.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
Yeah? How's our new witness?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
How are you holding up?
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Yeah.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
You use their witness.
That's right.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Yeah. I'm awake.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Read me what she said.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
...one of the other nurses?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What difference can that make...? All right...
Uh...the admitting nurse...
What did she do?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.' 'Kathy Costello...'
The 'History'...?
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
The broad has disappeared...
The Hospital...?
...yeah...good...
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
...four years ago...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I need a cigarette! She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart... I need a cigarette...
What the hell are you doing here?
We got to talk.
What are you doing in New York...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association. The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago. She wanted to move to Boston. How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I don't know.
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe  did you hear what I said...?
I don't want a mistrial.
Dr. Gruber.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
He's not in, Sir.
Where is he?
I...please. My wife...my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him..
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone. He'll be back in a week... If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
D'you find an apartment?
Still looking.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Why?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
My exhusband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
Laura.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
I think I will.
Jimmy! That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
And are they going to get it?
They might. Yes. That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe what?
Maybe I can do something right.
And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time ?
What...?
Is this a bad time.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
...and is that serious?
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
Why don't you get some rest?
I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
Do you think it's my fault?
Isn't there something you...
That's not the question. It's over. Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You're talking like a drunk.
That's what I am.
And it's over...?
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
I...do you want me to leave?
You do what you want. You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
I...
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Who told you that?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever  you don't have to go to school...
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Joe... Joe...
Stop pressuring me...
You're pressuring yourself...
No...no...
Yes. We've all got to let go.
Is it over?
No.
What are you going to do?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Thank you.
I have to talk to you.
Call the A.M.A. to Laura) ...I can't talk now. ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...

Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Missus...
We have a renewyoursubscription offer...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
I was held up.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
That's it...? Come on, guys...life is too short... You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...things change.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I'm sure you would.
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I had a witness disappear on me.
That happens.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
What?
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nineminute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Listen to me, fella...
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hardass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Are you done?
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Mr. Concannon...?
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
Exception!
Noted. Thank you. Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
No.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Well, maybe you better do that, then. You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
Dr. Gruber ...
Yes? Galvin, right?
I appreciatea man as busy as
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
I read the hospital report on your client.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
... and you're going to do that?
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
Yes.
Why?
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors ...
Her doctors killed her.
) I'm sorry ...?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
The most respected ...
Whose side are you arguing ...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate'  No offense, but we all know where the money's going to ... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party ...? Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Okay. I'll meet you here. Tuesday night ... I gotta go. You going my way?
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss ...
I understand.
... the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ...
Thank you ...
... that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
Yes. I wrote it.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Negligent. Yes...it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Thank you.
Dr. Thompson...?
It was good of you to meet...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
That's what I'd planned to...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...I made a reservation at...
...apartment. No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
...What difference would...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventysix. In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I didn't do too well for you.
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Yes...I...yes.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Well...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
I...um...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Why is that?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
I am seventyfour years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
She getting good care over there?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
'Code Blue'...
It's a common medical term.
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
... that's all right.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand ...
We just ...
What is this going to cost?
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain onethird ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are...?
Hold on a second.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
It's all right, Mickey.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours... You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years. Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
What you thought!? What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would. They took it back.
I understand. I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
It's a crime.
Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
No.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I . . ..
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today. Isn't that right? Isn't that right...?
I...yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
I...
You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
They lied.
`They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
I do. Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears? This is a...why? Why would you do that?
I thought I would need it.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Huh!
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way.
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Objection! This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
I'll rule on that presently. Proceed.
No further questions.
You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form. It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I'm going to uphold that.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Just as you are, Sir...
Are you boardcertified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventyfour years old.
Uhhuh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I'm on the staff of...
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available. I am seventyfour years old, I am not boardcertified. I have been practicing medicine for fortysix years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
I did.
Objection.
Ed Concannon.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Objection, we've...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Objection!
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Yes.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
...I was one of a group of...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Yes.
Anything special about the case?
When she...
Thank you. When Debby...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Ms. Nevins, nurseanesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
That's right.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
Yes.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
Yes!
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Tell us.
What are you doing here?
Mickey told me to come back to work.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
... yes. Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Gruber...
Mickey told him to call. 'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
... he wants to testify ...?
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean? To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
This is going to drive the ante up.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office ...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
What does it mean?
They want to settle. It means a lot of money.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Yes. It would be.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. I can't do it. I can't take it.
He was accused of jury tampering.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventyeight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
Four cases in three years ...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No  we don't want this case in court.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
What did he find?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
As far as we know, nothing.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
I'm fine.
Good. You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
Ah. How did they treat you?
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
The district attorney's office will comply provided 
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
MayI be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Immunity.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twentyseven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was 
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
I know he was good.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
I just want to hear your story.
According to your statement you are a shortcon operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest  let your guard down, you follow?
No.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
I'm not a rat.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You wanted to know what happened after the lineup, I'm telling you.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
He loved her.
Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
That was all Fenster and McManus.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around. r I'm telling you straight, I swear. +
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold. +
You got him wrong.
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total + of seven times when he was on the force. + In every case, witnesses either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before they could testify. When they t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside  one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
I don't know about that.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
What lawyer?
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52 SCENE DELETED 52 53 INT. HOSPITAL  DAY 53 + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze  or whatever you want to call him  knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bangup job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me. After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
This is totally irrelevant.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Give a guy a break, huh?
What happened?
Then what?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
What call?
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Why didn't you say anything?
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too farfetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An excop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Wait a minute.
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't.
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't know what you're talking about.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
Then why didn't you help him?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
But Keaton...
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I said I never heard of him.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
I don't
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
But how  wait. You're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone?
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
He wanted me to live.
Why did he want you to live? A onetime dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless ratcripple? No, sir. Why'
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Because he was my friend.
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Edie...
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
This is all bullshit.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
I knew him. He would never 
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
If he's dead, Verbal  if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
Why lie about everything else, then?
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
You're not safe on your own.
You think he's..?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton  and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bagman than it is to buy a cop.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught  Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
No, no, no, no, no.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
And I am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions.
You know damn well what I think.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twentyseven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninetyone million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this  Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
Kobayashi.
What do you mean I can't see him?
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitchslapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Did they charge him with anything?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
What'the fuck is that?
When does he post bail?
Two hours, tops.
I want to see him.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
Someplace else, then.
Where?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
Which is shit.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
I'11 find him.
Waste of time.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
What?
Nothing. Something I  forget it.
We're on vacation.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
I shivved him.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
Business or personal?
A little of both.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
You didn't know.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Who is he?
Some Limey. He's a middleman for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
We want to meet him.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Tell him we'll meet.
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninetyone million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
Who's your boss?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
I work for Keyser Sate.
You set up the lineup.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
What about Redfoot?
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
The answer is no.
Mr. Soze will be most 
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Mr. So My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Neither do we.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus. f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very + determined.
We'll see.
What did you say?
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
You're lying.
Am I? 92 92 INT. HALLWAY  FIFTIETH FLOOR
How are you, Keaton?
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Ready?
What time is it?
Let's say for example 
This I had to see myself.
with what?
You know damn well, deadman.
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
County. I was in for fraud.
You were waiting for a lineup then, too. What happened with that?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
How do you do?
Verb  Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
What the hell do you want?
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys 
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things 
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Get out.
If you'll just let me 
Don't hurt me.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
They  That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job  Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
What fence? Who?
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Never heard of him.
You have to come.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
They  They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
Tough break.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
You watch your mouth.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
I was out of line.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
Forget it. I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
How are they going to do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Fenster and Hockney?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Three million?
Maybe more.
No killing?
Not if we do it my way.
We'll make it.
Don't do this. Send her a card  something.
We'll make it.
What is it Keaton?
Something  I don't know. I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
What is this?
Who's Keyser Soze?
Whatare they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Hungarian?
Keaton, I can't just 
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened  Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
What if I
Just do what I tell you.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
What are we gonna do?
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Me too.
Did you hear what he just said?
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
You heard right.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all about?
He's alright.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzelman? What's your story?
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Why don't you just calm down'
What do you care what he says?
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
Dig.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Can we stealth these guys?
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready  which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
You are a criminal.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Then who goes?
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
They fucking know everything.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
How many times have you been in a line up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers  they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics  nothing you can do.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
I don't want to know.
This is not right.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
I don't know. This is bad.
I know who he is.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
A glass of water would be nice.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Umm ...
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
I'm having a stroke.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police  Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Just forget about it.
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They want more time to think about investing.
Goddamnit.
They just said they wanted time.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we 
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Come home, Dean.
Alright.
That's enough, Edie.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
Edie, please.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too. + &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Jack. What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
Yeah.
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
There was ninetyone million 
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
What was the money for?
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
I don't get it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Who ?
Bear with me here...
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him. +
And ?
Keyser Soze
There's more.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Thought you was followin' me.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me. We didn't talk about no other fella.
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Nothin's bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
You gonna share your half with him?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Oh, them. Hell, I seen them.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Yeah?
I'm a damn good shot. See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
Far enough.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
More.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Say, Ned... ?
Yeah.
How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer?
I don't like the question.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
How many you killed, Kid?
Five. I killed five of 'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife.
Jesus. You done this before?
Plenty of times.
His pistol must of jammed.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
That was your idea, I wanted to...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
I don't kill nobody without him.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Depends what he told you. About Bill, you mean?
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
We done that stuff.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That redhaired one, you could spot a halfmile off, I bet.
An' if I spot 'em?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Just like that?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before. I'm more killer than him.
Yeah?
Hell, yeah.
What is it, son?
Two more hogs got the fever.
Who's he?
Best we move that pig.
Hullo, paw.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
That fella come by... Tom.
Tom?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
The Kid, yeah...
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week... how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Well, I come back, didn't I?
Did you... did you... ?
Did I what?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
No... I meant...
What?
Kkkill somebody?
Who said that?
Nnobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years?
Eleven.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans. Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money... What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Well, I guess they got it comin'... But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Two weeks, I guess.
This Kid, what's he like?
Three ways?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
He musta been movin' right along.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm... Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
It ain't nothin', don't fret it. She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Sally?
She gave me the evil eye.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her. She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Well, she...
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters. Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
You ain't like that no more.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You ain't like that no more.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
No. I mean... ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that. A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh. Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
Sometimes... yeah. I don't miss it all that much.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Yeah.
He hit you?
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
He ain't shootin' our way no more. He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Beats the hell out of me.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
HEY.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Shit.
How far kin you see?
Jesus.
Fifty yards ain't bad. Guess we better get along.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back... Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows. I guess we could use some now.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
I know it's rainin', Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
No.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Yeah?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Ned... Is that you, Ned? Ned, I seen... death.
Easy, Bill.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river. He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Easy, Bill, easy.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
Two.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
We got to kill this other one first. Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
You want the Spencer, Bill?
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
I ain't waitin', Bill. I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
I... I... think I'm... shot.
You ain't shot.
Pppplease, I'm not armed. Mmmy Ggod. You killed... Little Bill.
You sure you ain't armed?
I never cccarry arms. I'm... a writer.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Bbbooks. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Yeah.
Whwhwho did you kill first?
Huh?
Whwhwhen confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Yeah?
I was lucky in the order. I always been lucky killin' folks.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
I could tell you who was last, mister.
William Munny, yeah.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Hold on, mister. Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me... ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
I could of... easy.
Yeah, I guess so.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell coldblooded damn killer.
Maybe I ain't.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
He said that, huh?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Well, how about it?
About what?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
What for?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Jesus!
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess. I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
She's passed on, Kid.
Huh?
Been gone near three years now.
Oh.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Three ways, I figured.
No.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
You're goin' back with him?
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Huh?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Lookin' at?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Easy, Kid, easy. Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
What business?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself. Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Well... I don't recollect.
You don't recollect!
Get some sleep, Kid.
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
Finish him, Ned.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
He got the boy's horse.
Did you kill him?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
Shit!
What happened, did you hit him?
Better reload it.
You missed him? You didn't...?
I got him.
He ain't killed.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
They takin' water?
Yeah.
When we gonna double back?
After a ways.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Shut up, Kid.
It's gonna get riper yet.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
He's in there.
Tell me right off if you see him.
Yup.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
You can shoot him.
Is it him?
Yup.
Did... you... get... him?
Yeah.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
Yeah, I guess so.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute. Was you ever scared in them days?
Say, Bill...
Yeah.
That was... the first one.
First one what?
First one I ever killed.
Yeah?
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true. That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
Hhell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a shshshit an'... an'...
Take a drink, Kid.
Oh Chchchrist... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... nnnever. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Well, I guguess they had it... comin'.
We all got it comin', Kid.
I trust you, Bill.
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Wha... what ffor?
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You... gonna take... the money?
You better get on back, Miss.
You could have it. All of it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Ned's share?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
He's... he's dead.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Who killed him?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
He hanged him? Shot him down?
Nno. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died. Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
A sign on him?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
About where you an' him was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
What'd Ned say?
Llies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Then... what?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Nno, sir?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
Nno. I wrwrwrwrite... I wr wrwrite...
Letters?
It's only a bbbbook...
A book, huh? I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
The... Duck of Death.
Dddduke. The Ddduke of Death.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Uh... Duke.
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Duke.
Duck, I says. "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
You were there?
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
But he was called...
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
And?
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
You... you mean... English Bob killed him while...?
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
But... if he doesn't miss?
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas. Look here, let me show you somethin'. See this here pistol?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
Is... is it... loaded?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
Rrrreally? You rrreally w wwant...?
Give it to him.
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Did you... kill him?
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Huh? Oh. Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
I guess you are ThreeFingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned. Now step aside. boys.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
No?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cutwhore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Property.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cutup whore.
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Hit your finger, huh?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
What's all that wood?
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Yeah?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bowlegged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
Yup.
All week?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
They really got all that money, them whores?
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe.
That much, huh?
You could run off them two cowboys.
I could run off them whores.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Alive?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
He admit it?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Uh... a little, maybe.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Shit and fried eggs.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska. Who's your friend?
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Books. He's my biographer.
Oh.
Not really... Maybe a couple of Peacemakers... I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Be careful with those, sonny.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Mmmm pistols.
Oh yeah.
I thought... you was an angel.
You ain't dead.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me. I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
I didn't mean no offense. I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up. Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Scouting?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Three days? I must be.
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Are you really going to kill them?
Yeah, I guess. There's still a payment, ain't there?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Advances?
Free ones?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Oh. Yeah.
You want... a free one.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
I... I guess not. I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Your wife?
Yeah. See?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Yeah, I guess.
She back in Kansas?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
Don't matter, we don't need no whips. Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
He tell you where them others is?
Nope.
He give 'em names?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess. Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Building his porch!
He's coming ain't he?
'Course he's coming.
What'd he say?
Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Maybe he ain't so tough.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe. Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Ah, I see.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
What wife? He don't have no wife.
He said...
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
You told them cowboys you had it.
We was... lyin'.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect? FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES? The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little. STUPID CUNTS!
Rain's coming.
Thank God.
She's gonna live. She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
No?
All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
But what they done, they...
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
I fined 'em instead.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Like whores?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Innocent of what?
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
...I got a present for you.
Why?
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
Well, go get it then.
Where is it?
On a bench, across the street.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this. It works the quadriceps.
How long have you been married?
Twelve years.
How did you get together?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore. If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
How so?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain. I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game. It's not a thing many people would understand.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seventhreeseven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventytwo die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed. I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
And what was that explanation?
Is this a religious thing?
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality  I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth  I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident. How's your vision?
Fine.
Where were you sitting on the train?
Against a window.
In the passenger car?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Was your family traveling with you?
No.
Did you get up from your seat?
No.
You like sports?
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Is that right?
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Not really.
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Yeah, hello.
Is David Dunne there?
He doesn't look very threatening.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I want to sleep here tonight.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I won't make any noise.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty
In under six seconds. I've heard.
I'm going to go in.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Why'd you do that?
Just one
Jeremy. I'm going in. I have to do some things.
What things?
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
There's nothing to do.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
No.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
No.
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How much can you lift?
No.
I mean if you knew karate?
No Jeremy.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
How much did you take off?
I lied.
How much is it?
Two hundred and seventy.
What do you do if something happens?
Get mom.
How many did you put on that time?
All of it.
There's no more left?
I'm sleeping in my room.
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
Do you know why?
I know now.
Know what?
You're secret identity. That man was right.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
Elijah was wrong.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You're lying.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
I'll just shoot him once.
Jeremy listen to what
Don't be scared.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
What's he look like?
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
Yeah?
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
When?
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
We are.
He's doing well today.
I'm very proud of him. He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally. They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
He's kind of a miracle.
Yes he is.
You've never been sick?
I don't know for sure. ...I don't think so.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Seventyfive percent.
Seventyfive percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
What's he talking about?
In college. A car accident.
Was it serious?
I assumed because of the train.
You assumed wrong.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step. What is over?
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years... And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed. And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
What was your idea Elijah?
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
You've misunderstood.
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
It's for last week's game.
I've come to understand that... An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
What do you want?
Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
We've already begun.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Are you for real?
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting. Now all I need is your credit card number.
Just give me a minute.
Is there a problem?
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying. If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level. It's nosebleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
I thought he was carrying something.
But not a knife?
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. Like on t.v.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
Like what?
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Yes.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
I don't know what you're asking?
You're skill.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. Xray vision, things of that sort.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
I have to go now.
One last question.
Quick.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fiftyfifty shot at the color.
That's not what I witnessed David.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
Are you finished?
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me. Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
What does that mean?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I know.
Is Jeremy okay?
He's asleep.
Oh.
I don't know. It's been a while.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
...I can't remember.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Yes.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
No that's it.
When was the last time I wore pink?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh shit...
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
I've come to a decision.
Oh.
Megan?
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
I remember you.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait. I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
You use your sleeve.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
He's dealing with a lot of things. I think he needs to find answers himself.
Would you like to try going
Yes.
out again?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Jesus.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
...I think rust.
Rust?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What was that?
We're supposed to be honest.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
My turn. When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I'm not sure.
Think carefully?
What about the game?
It's finished. I won.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay. I think that was the first time. Does that count?
That counts.
Why?
I don't know Megan.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Wrap it up.
You've made a considerably wise decision.
Once again please?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
How old is Jeb?
Four.
No.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
What did I say?
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I'm listening.
I'll keep it in my office room.
What about Jeb?
I have a lock on the door.
Yes?
Is Noel in?
No sir he is not. I read about you in the paper.
Oh.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Wow.
I had to put him down.
Proceed.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Is that the entire message?
Yes.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
What's that? ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
I want my lawyer!
I axed you a question.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I want to stay.
I said come on!
Toby! Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Who was that on the phone?
Wrong number.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way  rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama  she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
No! No! Please!
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
There's someone in the house.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Help me, Grace, help...
Like you helped her, Jake?
Morning Grace.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Oh?
Anybody hurt?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self. Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
You fuck this guy  get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
No baby, you got it wrong.
This road don't go to Globe, Grace  where were you going to meet me?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don't!
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Let me get your change.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Son of a bitch!
Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
You got a beer?
What kind?
Beck's.
No Beck's. A1, Coors...
Heineken?
No, we ain't got no Heineken. We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
No. Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
Shasta! Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that? Sorry about that, mister. Let's see, you want $3.25. You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Sure, I'll try.
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like
I don't care, just get me there.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
How much?
One way, or round trip?
One way.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
Twentyseven, fifty. That's all I got.
The ticket is 30.55.
Keep your change. Bus threetwentythree. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
I'm sorry. It's just ... you know ...
That's a shame, Bobby. A real shame.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
"Arkady"
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess. This robber  he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
With a <u>shotgun</u>! She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive. I mean, what are the odds?
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mister... if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know? So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fiftydollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see? The bus depot here has a Western Union thing. And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Which you don't have.
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteenthousand dollars, you call me  collect  then ask me to wire you onehundredfifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
A hundredfortyfive would probably cover it.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk: I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteenthousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>. I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
What'd you say to me!
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
Morning, officer.
Son. Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
Get in.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today. You're not planning on staying are you?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
My name is Bobby. Now I'm not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I like that about me, beautiful.
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
No trouble at all, really.
Wasn't nothing.
Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.
That's all right. I got it.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Superior? What for?
Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Where you coming from?
All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
I don't know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some action there.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens when you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
That's good. Cools you right off. I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Nice place.
Thank you.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Come here.
My face tell you all that?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
The same thing you do.
There. All done. Lift me down.
What?
Lift me down.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Like you.
Beautiful?
I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
I have an idea.
And what would that be?
You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.
Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
How do you know he's still not here?
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Are there snakes out here?
They hear you comin'. They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.
You love him?
No.
Did you ever?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Is that why you're with him?
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me. He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You could leave him.
I don't know how.
Walk away.
It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.
Don't feel like nothing.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women. You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
You'd never understand.
Try me.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You mean the Shaman?
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see... ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Yeah.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u>  that's bullshit  they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
I'm sorry...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?
Yeah.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Is it pretty?
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Darrell? You know he and Jake are...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
Where?
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
What do you mean?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
In <u>cash</u>?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
Onehundredthousand!? That sonofabitch.
It takes a key. He keeps it on himself all the time. I mean <u>all the time</u>. It scratches up against me when we do it.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Kill him.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it... I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Stop it.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.
Are you sure?... About me, I mean?
I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want. The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away. It was your idea, remember? I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Grace ... Grace?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
The money's right here! Get the key!
No! You get it!
Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you?
I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Good thinking. What's all this?
I'm not coming back.
I can't see it.
It should be just up ahead. Hold on ... there! There it is!
Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
But I thought 
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Anywhere?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
You already have.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
What are you talking about?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>... You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
Why?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
You could give me my gun back.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I think you're a lying, backstabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
My mother died in this canyon.
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Hope is a fourletter word.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
Bobby? Are you all right?
I busted my leg!
Can you make it back up?
Grace  in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Why's that?
'Cause I love you.
And I love you too.
And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
<u>Jake</u>...
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
Soda. You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
Soda. You know.
I call the sheriff.
No! No police.
You Harlin?
Nope. Darrell.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
Will he be back soon?
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
You own this place?
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
So?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is
Damn. Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither. Then of course the clouds come in...
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Darrell
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
So?
It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Great!
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
Time.
Twentyafterten.
Jesus. Twentyafterten and it must be ninety already.
Ninetytwo. Course half hour from now might be seventytwo. These clouds move around a lot.
Accident.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important. Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Hey.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
Another accident? You got to be more careful.
What the hell happened to my car?
Bottom hose was shot too. Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundredfifty bucks.
How much!?
Hundredfifty.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixtyfourandahalf Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixtyfourandahalf Mustang."
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through." Now you owe me a hundredfifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteenhundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, man. I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
Then you're only a hundredfortyfive in the hole. You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Now that's too bad. I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
...got no day, got no date. Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want. Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
I want my hundred and fortyfive dollars.
Hey there. I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back... You don't look so good.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundredfifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll
Twohundred.
What?
It's going to cost you twohundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me onefifty.
Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it! You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you? Didn't you read the sign.
What sign?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work? What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an accident and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
No! Okay! Okay!
What's the matter? The fight gone out of you? I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Look, Harlin.
Darrell.
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
What you want?
Open up!
We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up.
What the hell ... oh, it's you. Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over. What do you want?
I want my car.
You got the money?
Twohundred dollars in hundreddollar bills. And this morning you was broke.
That's none of your business. Get the keys.
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
No.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter for the juke?
What?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
How about I pick one out for you?
You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Cause she's dead.
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that movie.
You're too quick for me.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you. I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet that is.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him. You're not going to get much better in this town.
That's what I thought until you came riding in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It's a cool car. Want to take me for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
How old are you?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
You're too late, Toby. We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you talking about?
What's your name anyway?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Will you shut up!
Don't be afraid of him none. I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Get away from me!
Who the hell is this!?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I swear to you that's all that happened. I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
A lot that means.
Grace, tell him.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
You broke my nose!
It ain't broke.
What the fuck do you want?
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and fingerfucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Yeah...
Say, what happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be
Yeah, I know. More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Darrell's a moron.
California...
Live there?
Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so. Listen, McKenna about your wife: If I had known she was married
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it? Not a wit. Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hey!
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body. Don't be offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics is a free man. I envy that. Beside, how can I blame you? That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
She does at that. I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh? Women.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that. I bet she led you on good, didn't she? Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face. I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you?
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
What can I do for you, lad?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.
Sweet Grace? What about her?
About what you said this morning.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fiftythousand dollars.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a madman.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off. I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
What makes you say that?
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
And what does that make you?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
Well, I guess I have what you call a lovehate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
How much could you get?
Maybe ... tenthousand. And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I'm not your boy. I don't like you. I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that. I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead... Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good. I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How do you want it?
How the hell should I know? I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.
Be quiet, boy. I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>... This is what you do: Go to the house to see her.
And tell her what?
...I don't know. Tell her you had to see her. Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman. A young buck like you must be good at that. Then ... maybe shift the conversation. Get her thinking about that jeep of hers. She loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Next time you'll do just fine.
No!
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
I like Darrell. He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
It's not what you think, Jake.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Wait a minute. Just listen to me...
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
Shhh! Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today. Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteenthousand. Give me twohundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy. But I need the the money. I've got to have the money.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
What are you talking about!
Come on, Jake 
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior. What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is twohundred dollars to get out of here with.
Twohundred dollars?
Twohundred dollars...I'll do it! I'll kill her!
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time? Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
What? You want to fight? Over her?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Mister!
Oh, shit!
That's right, Mister. You better be afraid. I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen. Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Oh, that tears it, Mister. I'm gonna bust you up but good. I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around. That's what I'm gonna do. You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister. I'm crazy. I'm psycho crazy.
Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm stompin' your ass.
You idiot! You don't even know what you're fighting over!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Mexico? You going to Mexico?
I'm leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket!
This means something to you? Jenny means something to me.
Hey! You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
Christ no!
Lost my eyes in Vyeeetnam. Lost them fighting the commies. Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure. You got change?
Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man. Christ.
Don't forget to open it for me. I can't be opening my own bottle.
Christ!
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He's only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you?
Hell no!
See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me. That's where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes. He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him. I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
Maybe I do.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing  are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
What?
...And everything is nothing too.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Who's cursed?
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
I got things to do.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Ain't over yet. Night is part of day; separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
More or less.
Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u>  or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
You know I won't be seeing you.
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
Soda. You got any soda?
Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien.
Soda. You know.
I call the policia.
No!
No police.
But, Senor
No police! Wait until I'm gone.
Senor, you need a doctor.
No police!
Kids.
Yeah. What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
He is at that. No so much a fault of his own. Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
What happened?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here. Toby's school class went up to the mine one day. School takes field trips up there every year. Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground. Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Jesus!
Yep. Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
I guess.
Like I said; you really can't blame the boy. Some people don't know how to avoid trouble. Know what I mean?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning. You're not from around here.
No, sir. And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just curious. That's a nasty cut you've got.
Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
That's too bad. I was hoping you were there. Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away. Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Wish I could help, Sheriff. But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car. Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Stay as long as you like, son. No rush.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Nice night for a drive. Morning really. I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra. What with that ruckus you had with Toby. Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice. If I hadn't defended myself 
Just cool down, son. I ain't accusing you of anything. Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Nope. No problems up the road.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
I don't understand what the
Just step from the car. Nice and slow.
Sure, Sheriff.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
What for?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
You bitch! You were in on it froom the start!
Shut up! The both of you. Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy. Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town? You smell like trouble. Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I didn't do anything.
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something. He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him. And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did. I was there. Like I said; I been watching you.
That's what this is all about? A shakedown? You picked the wrong people. We don't have any money.
Sure you do. Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house. It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him. Not for lack of trying.
What'd you think, boy? That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to? Not by a long shot. You're just the most gullible. How much did you get?
Thirtythousand dollars.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
Nobody's going to hang. We're all gonna walk away with a little something. I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. Onehundredthousand dollars. Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirtythree thousand. Give or take.
And you're taking?
John, what a surprise. I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
I know, Mr. Vesci. I know. I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had. You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
That's a shame, John. A real shame.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it. I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Let me guess. This robber; he gets your money.
No. He gets shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
With a shotgun. It kills him, and it shreads the money. I mean, what are the odds?
You're the gambler. You tell me.
I had to beat it before the cops showed up. I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all. So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fiftydollars so I could get my car. I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Let me get this straight: You owe me thirteenthousand dollars, you call me  collect  then ask me to wire you onehundredfifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
A hundredfortyfive really.
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk: I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteenthousand dollars and I want it. I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
Fucking kid. And look at you; breaking fucking pencils. You're a Neanderthal.
Hello? Hello!? Operator, I got disconnected. Hello . . .
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time? Is everybody in this town slap happy?
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
What? You want to fight? Over her?
You're fucked.
You know who I am? Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
They're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again. Now go away.
Not before I settle with you.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Stand up.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Mister!
Oh, shit!
That's right, Mister. You better be afraid. I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen. Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Oh, that tears it, Mister. I'm gonna bust you up but good. I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around. That's what I'm gonna do. You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister. I'm crazy. I'm psycho crazy.
Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like dynamite. When you go off somebody gets hurt. All right. Let's do this.
Get up, Mister! Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm beating you up.
You stupid punk! You don't even know what you're fighting over!
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Mexico? You're going to Mexico?
I'm leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket!
This means something to you? Jenny means something to me.
Nooo!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days. Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick. I'm gonna . . .
Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter?
What?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
What happened to your hand?
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
Got any requests?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
How about I pick one out for you?
You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
She's dead.
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that one movie.
You're too quick for me.
Hey, Mister. Mister. I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you. I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet that is.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you. If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him. You're not going to get much better in this town.
That's what I thought until you came riding in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It's cool. Want to take me for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
How old are you?
Eighteen. Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could
You're too late, Toby. We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you talking about?
What's your name anyway?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Will you shut up!
Don't be afraid of him none. I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Get away from me!
I asked you a question.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of.
I want to stay.
I said come on!
Toby! Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Husband . . .?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I . . I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I swear to you that's all that happened. I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
A lot that means.
Grace, tell him.
I have half a mind to
Is this what it's all about? You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you? Forget it. You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you. I deserve it for being an idiot. But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You've got to be
Yeah, I know. More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna. That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
John Stewart.
What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated. I pulled in to have it fixed.
Where you headed?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Live there?
Got work. I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that. Just sail away until all he was was a memory. I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so. Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife: If I had known she was married
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it? Not a wit. Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Wait a second
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hey!
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body. Don't be offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics is a free man. I envy you that. Beside, I can hardly blame you. That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
She does at that. I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect? But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her. What are you to do, eh? Women.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she? Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers. Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you?
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
Why would I kill her?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games. Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fiftythousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right? You just want to rattle me. Right?
Good Lord. What happened to you?
Just ran into a little trouble.
Another accident? You've really got to be more careful. Can I get you a drink?
No.
Hungry?
No.
I'm surprised to see you. I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I had a problem getting my car back.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Nice office you've got.
I do all right. Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell. You can turn a few dollars that way.
Isn't that illegal?
Now what can I do for you?
I was hoping we could talk.
Talk? About what?
About things. About your wife.
Sweet Grace? What about her?
About what you said this morning.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fiftythousand dollars.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a mad man.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning. In your car.
That was just loose talk. I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.
What makes you say that?
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
And what does that make you?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
Let's say I do want her dead. What is it you want? This morning you weren't a killer.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here? That doesn't seem much for a murder.
How do you put a price on murder?
I put it at fiftythousand dollars, minus your cut, of course. Which is?
Make it twenty.
Twentythousand? I don't have that kind of money. I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead. I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise. Twentythousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
How much could you get?
Maybe . . . tenthousand. And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake. You're having your wife killed. I'm the one who's neck is stuck out. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I'm not your boy, Jake. I don't like you, and I don't like what you are. I got no choice but to do business with you. This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Don't say that. I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead. Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Do we shake hands?
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
I guess I might as well get this done with.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way. Now listen to me: It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good. I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
What should I do?
How the hell should I know? I've never had a wife killed before. I guess I should have hired a professional.
You want to do this yourself? I don't have to do this, you know.
Be quiet, boy. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be . . .
This is what you do: Go to the house to see her.
And tell her what?
I went to your place. We talked, just like you told me. We drove out into the desert . . .
Is the job done?
No.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right? What's the matter? You were hoping to get it on home video? A keepsake for the grandkids. Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
You know what I mean.
I know all right. I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife. You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice. From that you'd just turn and walk away. But to kill; to get that blood on your hands. You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain. And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
I guess I have what you'd call a lovehate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
I hate loving her. I hate the kind of her person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays. I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise. And I certainly love her too much to kill her. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. But you? You got the killing in you, boy.
Shut up.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Drop it, Jake.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
SHUT UP!
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Thirteenthousand dollars. Had you done it. Isn't that what we agreed on?
You think that's a lot of money?
All I have in the world.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
No.
Yeah, well, me too.
Trouble with the car again?
You could say. I don't even have it yet.
Darrell giving you problems?
He did more work on the car. He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Fifty dollars more. That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from? Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
It's not like that.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Wait a minute. Just listen to me
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
Jake
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow twohundred dollars. Or maybe twothousand. Or twentythousand. Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
That's not the reason I'm here. I swear it.
There's another reason? It better be good.
I came for Grace.
You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.
Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
That's a thick change of heart.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl. Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me. Same way Grace played us this morning. I don't like that, Jake. Not twice in one day. And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
That's a lot of talk. A whole lot of talk.
Damn it, Jake. If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me. And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteenthousand. Give me two hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money. I've got to have the money.
I'm curious about something. I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom. Now you make straight for it.
Come on, Jake
Don't Jake me, boy! It's a big house. Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before. Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Then maybe this afternoon. When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Christ, Jake, please
Is that what happened? Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
You're not talking sense.
Sense? If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you? Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man. Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it. A man's got to protect his home. His wife. You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
What difference does it make if I slept with her. You don't care about Grace.
You're right. I don't give a damn about her. But to fuck a man's wife behind his back? That just makes a fool out of him. I don't like being made a fool of.
I don't blame you. What man would? I admit it, okay? I came back here and I made it with Grace. But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Not from where I stand.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her. She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
What are you babbling about?
Think about it. How do you think I got in here? Did you hear any glass break? Did you hear a door splinter? How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit? Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked? Is that what happened?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
You know what kind of woman Grace is. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra. What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you? What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead? Let me kill her. All I want is twohundred dollars to get out of here with.
Twohundred dollars.
Twohundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
My name is John. Now I'm not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
My cup runneth over, beauti
It's Grace.
May I carry your package, Grace?
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
You should be more careful.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
No trouble at all, really.
Wasn't nothing.
Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.
That's all right. I got it.
It's nothing. Really.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes. Had them long as I can remember.
That a fact?
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Yes, I have.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending. But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself. I deserve nice things.
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
Thank you, John.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that? Just because I help a lady with her package?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I just drove in this morning.
Drove into Sierra? What for?
Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up the road.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back. Maybe they never would have found you. Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Yeah, my luck. I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Least you can leave.
Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how long that's going to take.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Where you coming from?
All over. Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
I don't know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some work there.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens if you lose?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Somewhere else. I've never been anywhere else. Just once. Years ago. Went to the state fair. It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I couldn't stay in this place. I wouldn't. I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
That's good. Cools you right off. I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Nice place you got here.
Thank you.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman.
A medicine man?
Those are white words, not ours.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Come here.
My face tell you all that?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
The same thing you do.
There. All done. Lift me down.
What?
Lift me down.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look.
Like you.
Beautiful?
Like they're made of polyester.
I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
I have ideas.
Such as?
All right, Grace. No more games.
Games?
You flirt with me, then you run cold. You lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go for being jerked around.
Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys. But you already know that. You read my fortune. Thanks for the lemonade.
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Damn it, Grace! Tell him.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.
You love him?
No.
Did you ever?
Depends on what you call love. When I was growing up I had nothing. I learned to want everything. I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket. He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together. I courted him. I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
All this nothing? I've spent my life in this stinking desert. It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me. He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker. Big fish in a small pond, he says. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
You just walk away.
It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would . . . do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Whatever it takes.
How far is it to California?
From here? I don't know. Far. Far enough.
Have you ever been there before?
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
Beautiful. Beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Take me with you.
I can't.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Grace, I can't. I can't even get out of here myself. I need a hundredfifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than onehundredfifty dollars.
Where?
Jake.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
He doesn't give it to us. We take it.
From?
He's got money. In a floor safe in the living room. I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time. More like brags. He loves his money. Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
You live pretty good.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
How much money has he got?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundredthousand.
Onehundredthousand!? That sonof abitch lied to me.
Lied? What do you mean?
I . . . nothing. Just something he said. So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination
It's not a combination lock. It takes a key. He keeps it on him all the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up against me when we do it.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
We'd have to kill him.
John? John where are you going?
I think this heat is making me crazy. I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
John, please
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
What are you talking about?
Kill someone. I can't do it.
Is it so bad? It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
Shit!
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Jesus Christ! Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace. I can't do it.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now. Is there something you wanted?
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
There is no us, remember?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
I've thought about you every second since I left. I can still taste you on my lips.
Stop it.
Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't leave. I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.
Are you sure? About me, I mean?
I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
Grace . . . Grace?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
What was I supposed to do?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
Where's the safe?
I don't know.
You don't know? Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
I'm not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.
Oh, that's great. We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
Don't yell at me!
Nothing. There's no safe under here.
There has to be!
There isn't! There's nothing under here but more floor. Jesus fucking Christ! We killed a man for nothing but floor.
It's got to be here. I heard him talk about it. He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
This is good. This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us. They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
You're calling Jake stupid? You!?
Don't yell at me! I know it's here! I know it!
There's easily a hundredthousand in there. More than that.
I told you. I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
If you want.
We're going all the way. Together.
Let's go in the bedroom.
No.
Let's do it here.
What about him?
Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.
You got a suitcase?
Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Where are you going?
To get my car.
Wait. What about . . . him?
Put some clothes on him. When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert. It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
John!? What the hell's the matter with you?
I . . . nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep in the garage. Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away. Might buy us some time.
Yeah. Good thinking.
Had push it in. Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Funny thing.
John . . .?
Grace! Just . . . let me handle this. Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk. If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it. Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Sheriff Potter, please. I can't go to jail. I wanted no part of it.
You liar! You wanted him dead. You seduced me into killing him!
Onehundredthousand dollars. A little more.
Damn you! What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
That's all talk. He's got nothing on us. He let you kill Jake.
Not me. Us.
It doesn't matter. He was there and he let it happen. He can't take us in.
Give him the money.
What?
You heard me. Count it out.
He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.
He can kill us. I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty thousand dollars.
I shot him.
You killed him!
He was going to take the money.
Thirtythousand, that's all. We would have been free and clear. You didn't have to kill him.
It's our money. He had no right to take it.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Just drive.
Jesus, Grace. Did you have to kill him?
He was going to
I know. He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense. What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
Is that the kind of girl you think I am? What can I do to make you relax?
You could give me the gun.
Well, nothing.
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
Are you kidding? I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
What difference does it make? You killed Jake.
<u>We</u> killed Jake. And it's a big difference. You kill an old man, that's one thing. Nobody cares about an old man. You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
He was a crooked bastard. He would have killed us.
The police don't know that. And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck. I'll take you as far as California. If we can even make that. After that I'm cutting you loose.
But I want to say with you,
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again? You take your hald of the money and run. You might want to try Mexico. With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you. Don't you think I care about you?
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch. But it's nice to know you care.
John!
Grace!
Are you all right?
I think I busted my leg.
Can you climb back up.
I can't make it. Grace? Grace!?
I'm here.
Grace, listen to me. In the trunk of my car is a rope. It should reach down here. Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
I'll get it.
John! Can you hear me? Are you still there?
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
John, throw me the keys.
What for?
The trunk. It's locked.
It's not locked. I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
It's . . . it's locked.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Bullshit, Grace. You were going to drive off and leave me here.
No. I swear it.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Walk to where? We're fifty miles to the nearest town. It's going to be over onehundred degrees today. How far do you think you're going to get?
Someone will find me.
Yeah, they'll find you. Dried up and twice dead.
You idiot! You'll kill us both!
At least I'll have company when I die. Ain't that right, Jake?
For Christ's sake, John! Throw me the keys!
What do you say, Jake? Should we trust her? No? I didn't think so.
Fuck you! Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you! John . . . John!?
Jake. I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who the hell is this!?
Who was that on the phone?
Wrong number.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You never said anything. About the drapes.
They look nice.
You haven't even looked at them once.
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
Uhhuh
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
How could I? I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
I don't hear anything. You were dreaming. Or maybe the wind blew something over.
The wind isn't blowing.
Jake, what is that?
What does it look like?
When did you buy a gun?
Oh my God, Jake, no. If it is someone they'll go away. Or call the police. Don't go out there.
What are you afraid of? I'm the one's got the gun. Stay here.
Jake. No. No!
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Yes. Yes it is.
Taking a little trip?
I had a fight with Jake. I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose. I'm going to take a bus to my sister's. I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Is that right? Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit. I know I've had my fill of this town. Sixteen years I've been the law and order here. So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place. Help people, I guess. Keep the peace. Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me. Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them. Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal. I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna? A murder?
I . . .
I could do that. 'Course we'd have to go back into town. There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened. A whole crowd of witnesses. That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
John . . .
Is that the way you want it, boy? A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert? Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
He killed him, Sheriff! I couldn't stop him! He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
For the love of God would you two give it a rest? Lord almighty. In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic. How far did you think you were going to get with this? Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat. Now use what little smarts you got. If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
What do you want?
Same thing you want. I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please. But that takes money.
. . .at the very least. I know there was more than thirtythousand dollars. Now, how much did you get?
Don't tell him anything. He can't do this.
Can't I? You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk. What do you think, boy?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna. Just put it in there.
John
That wasn't so bad. What's thirty somethousand to rich folks like you? It didn't hurt a bit.
Sheriff Potter.
What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is. Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
You pay Toby no mind. He just likes to show off for his girl. Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
Poor thing. Is she all right?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring. That's when she started shooting. Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Lord! Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Baby didn't die. Just froze off all it's finger and toes. Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now. But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it. Now she died.
Let me get your change.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Ned! Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
It'd serve you right. Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
You got beer?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin. We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
No. We got Miller. Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Shasta! Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that? Sorry about that, hon. Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Yeah, I'll try.
You want somethin'?
You Harlin?
Nope. Darrell.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
Will he be back soon?
Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.
You own this place?
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
But he's dead.
So?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is
Damn. Gonna be another hot one today.
That'll make five in a row. Never seen it so hot. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze. I was in Mexico this one time
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.
It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Somewhere else? Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here. How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?
Hey!
Yeah, I can fix it. Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
Time.
What time is it now?
Twentyafterten.
Jesus. Twentyafterten and it must be ninety already.
Ninetytwo. Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Accident.
You got to be more careful. I remember one time
Yeah, right. Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Truck stop up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Just a car.
Hey.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Nothing.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head. It was an accident.
Another accident? You got to be more careful.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
How much?
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundredfifty bucks.
How much!?
Hundredfifty.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty fourandahalf Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixtyfourandahalf Mustang.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through. Now you owe me a hundredfifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteenhundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Listen, man. I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Then you're only a hundredforty five in the hole. Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
I don't have a credit card. They took my wallet.
Now that's too bad. I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You son of a bitch!
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundredfortyfive dollars.
Hey there. I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back. You don't look so good.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You've been there?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll
Twohundred.
What?
It's going to cost you twohundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me onefifty.
Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I didn't tell you to do it! You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you? I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket. Then you get in an accident and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna blame then? They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation? You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Take it. As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket. You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
You listen to me, you fancy city man. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her. Now get out of here! You're stinking up my garage.
No!
What's the matter? The fight gone out of you? I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Yeah, you better remember that.
Goddamn you! You son of a bitch!
There you go, sweet talking me again.
What you want?
Open up!
We're closed. Come back in the morning.
It is morning.
Come back when the sun comes up.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured. What do you want?
I want my car.
You got the money?
Twohundred dollars in hundred dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.
What's it to you?
I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Can I help you, sir?
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I . . . Mexico. You got a bus that goes to Mexico? That's where I have to go.
Where in Mexico would you like
I don't care, just get me there.
We have a bus to Mexico. Arrives in two hours. Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
How much.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Thirty even.
Twentyseven, fifty. That's all I got.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
I bought a beer. That was two fifty. I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
I'm sorry, sir. It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Yeah. Just a little short. Figures. I just wanted to get out, that's all.
Please, you don't understand. I have to get out of here. They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me. If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here. I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
I'll give you the money! Okay? I'll give you twofifty. Just . . . just, please.
Onehundredthirteen degrees. That was back in July of fortyseven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Hundred and eight already.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
Will be.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
You got two years on me. What's that make me?
It's nonsense.
It is not.
A coin's got two sides. When you flip it there's a fiftyfifty chance it'll be heads or tails. Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
It will.
No it won't. You just don't know shit about statistics.
And what are you? A rocket scientist?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Put your money where your chicken lipped mouth is. I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Well, a man with some gumption. How much money you got?
Nothing.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
It's a Movado.
Never heard of it. It's got no day or date. Hell, it ain't even got numbers. What's the matter? You couldn't afford a Timex?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler. He won't give you less than fourhundred for it.
Thirtybucks? That's it?
That's my morning's pay.
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
Hey! You there!
You want something, old man?
Don't call me old man. Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You want something?
Yeah I want something. I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that?
I'm sorry, I didn't
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
I don't know. I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
Christ no!
Lost my eyes on Okinawa. Lost them fighting the war. Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry. Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure. You got change?
Change? You want my change? I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man. Christ.
Get me a Dr. Peppa! I don't want no Pepsi. Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Yeah, yeah.
Don't forget to open it for me. I can't be opening my own bottle.
Christ!
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He's only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you?
He no!
See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me. That's where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes. He was just a pup then . . .
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
I can see just fine. For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Maybe I do.
Or maybe you just think you do. You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Think you'll live that long?
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
I won't hold my breath.
The day wasn't so bad. We all got through it all right.
Ain't over yet. Night is part of day; separate, but equal. Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog. The kiss of death. It's all the same.
You don't fear death?
We was born to die, boy. From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head. You just don't know where, or when, or how. Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is that it?
More or less.
Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either. I don't guess I'll be seeing you again. Take it easy.
Same back at you.
Any parting words of wisdom?
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
Nine thirty
Might be tight.
Tight? My watch says 7:30.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your ArmyoftheTwelveMonkeys factor.
What? What did you say?
Twelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
 so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. All they got was his name. They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
He's been tested for drugs?
Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
You have him in restraints.
Were you listening? We got two officers in the hospital. Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet.
That would explain the bruises, I guess. The struggle.
You want to go in? Examine him?
Yes, please. You said he gave a name...
James Cole. That's everything we got. None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
No, thank you.
I'll be right here...just in case.
One dozen bolt cutters! Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
You really want to know?
No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Your psychiatrist? Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Expsychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist? And now she's spray painting our building?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS? You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretendfriendto animals"?! I'll tell you why: because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing  I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Then how come she knows what's going on?
What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter. Have I ever "developed" a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do? I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT! YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT? NOW  WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
He should have been in restraints. It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to it?
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him  I've seen him somewhere and...
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
I said it was bad judgment! What else do you want me to say?
You see what I mean? You're being defensive. Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
He was fully sedated!
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
He kidnapped you, Kathryn. You saw him murder someone. You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too. You were under tremendous emotional stress.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me  he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that. You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist. You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry  it's the latest religion. And we're the priests  we decide what's right and what's wrong we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith.
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole. Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered.
Uh, that message...me?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make that call?
I couldn't call! You sent me to the wrong year! It was 1989.
But you know what's real now?
Yes, sir.
JOSE!
Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Jo...Jose????
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts! Here, take this.
Me? Are you kiddin? You're the one! You were a hero, man. They gave you a pardon! And whadda you do? You come back and fuck with your teeth! Wow!
How did you find me?
The phone call, man. The phone call.
The call I just made? Five minutes ago?
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call. I been in training for this a couple a months now  ever since I got back from that... "weird" war we were in. You remember that? Here, take it, man! You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
Hey, man...
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
What'd they give you? Thorazine? How much? Learn your drugs  know your doses.
I need to make a telephone call.
A telephone call? That's communication with the outside world! Doctor's discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness. In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon. But that's not why you're here. Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy. There's the TV. It's all right there. Commercials. We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated. What are we for then? We're consumers. Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what? You're mentally ill! That's a fact! If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices... SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILTIN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
Germs?!
In the 18th century there was no such thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing  no sane person anyway. Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick! He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy...crazy? Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
"What about the germs?" I say. He goes, "I don't believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
I'm not crazy.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word.
What's that mean?
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS! TOWELS! LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
They hurt you!
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
Wiping cut the human race! That's a great idea! But it's more of a long term thing  right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. I didn't say a word about "you know what".
What are you talking about???
You know  your plan.
What're you writing? You a reporter?
It's private.
A lawsuit? You going to sue them?
What....???
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up  try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part.
What...???
Not, "what", babe! When!
Never saw him before in my life. Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
You do know me. You helped me once.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Excuse me  what did you say?
Monkeys. Twelve of them.
County Hospital, right? 1989. The "Immaculate Escape"  am I right? Why, thank you  you look wonderful, too.
Listen to me  I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything. I can't stop you. I just want some information...
We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs. I am a new person! I'm completely adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani. Who chattered? Goines? Weller?
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future!
I don't have time to go upstairs. The police are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
I get it! This is your old plan, right?
Plan? What are you talking about?
Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?" You do remember that, don't you?
Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates We live underground! The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats. We're like moles or worms. All we want to do is study the original...
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Scientists. I'm supposed to report in to them. They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called, "voice mail". I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the County  I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being  do you understand that?
I need to go now.
I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you "James"?
"James"! Nobody ever calls me that.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information.
What kind of information?
It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything.
Change what?
I need to go.
Do you know why you're here, James.
Because I'm a good observer. Because I have a tough mind.
I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them.
You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
No.
Why not? Most people have some ID.
You wouldn't understand.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
I have to go.
A jail? Prison?
Underground.
Hiding?
I love this air. This is wonderful air.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean. No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
This is April, right?
July.
July?!
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
1995?
You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future?
No, 1995 is the past.
1995 is the future, James. This is 1989.
It was some lady. She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No. That's the reason they chose me  I remember things.
James, where did you grow up? Was it around here? Around Baltimore?
What?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. It's not the right number yet. That's the problem. Damn! How can I contact them?
It's just a shot to calm you.
No more drugs. Please...
I have to do this, James. You're very confused.
Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
1989. Six years for you. There's the sign! Right here!
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me?
You told me you'd help me. I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read, remember?
Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
It's the next step. I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. Zs that a radio? Does it play music?
You used to call me "James".
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
Everybody's got a gun. In this city...
"Never cry wolf!"
What?
My father told me that. "Never cry wolf." Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child? Something so bad...?
Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?
You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?
About an airport...before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have  the only one. I'm a little kid in it.
And I was in it? What did I do?
You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
It wasn't me before, James. It's become me now because of...what's happening. Please untie me.
No, I think it was always you. It's very strange.
You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing?
My notes. Observations. Clues.
Clues? What kind of clues?
A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. I've told you about them. They spread the virus. That's why we have to get to Philadelphia. I have to find them  it's my assignment.
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down  doesn't know if they're going to save him.
What do you mean  when you were a kid?
Nevermind. It's not real  it's a hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left!
Look, I'm warning you. You do anything, I'm going to go crazy  hurt people!
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise. But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
The man...with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He...
Are you hurt?
Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes...
Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!
I did him a favor. Now come on.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
I've got one now.
I told you what I want. Lock the door!
James, why don't we...?
Lock it now!
Mason???
Jeffrey Mason?
All I see are dead people. Everywhere. What's three more?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
The guy was a total fruitcake.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
We need gas.
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid.
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot. Look  there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot! Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
No. I want you to turn yourself in, James  It'll go much better for you if you do  but I'm not going to trick you.
That has your name on it. Give him cash.
You smell so good.
You have to give yourself up, you know.
What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
No! I...don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree.
See  you can drive after all!
Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry I locked you up. I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
What made you think that?
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James  a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I'm..."mentally divergent". I would love to believe that.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you.
I need help all right. They're coming after me.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
No gun! Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you...
No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he? Don't worry  it's all okay now. I'm not crazy any more! I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me. I want to get well...
I don't understand what we're doing.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those words on the wall  I've seen them before... I...I...dreamed them.
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
I thought I was in...prison again.
Just like that? You were in prison?
No, not really. It's...it's in my mind. Like you said.
You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I don't know  I don't remember.
The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?
It was? I didn't...know.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid. Where a boy...
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL!
What does this mean to you?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?
You said I had delusions  that I created a world  you said you could explain everything...
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to. I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
I want to be here. In this time. With you. I want to become...become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! You tried to call and...
You want me to rob him?
I...I...We need cash, James.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail  you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
You... you left them a message?
I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
They got your message, Kathryn. They played it for me. It was a bad recording...distorted. I didn't recognize your voice.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV.
Shh  don't talk. Hold still.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes  it can't change  but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different  you notice different things.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Flowers! What flowers?
Why are we doing this?
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows  we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I mean in my dream  I didn't realize it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I remember you...like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you.
That's what they were up to! Freeing animals!
On the walls  they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Airports all look the same. Maybe it's... James! Your moustache! It's slipping.
They may be looking for us, James. Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room.
I was here...as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you...looked just like you look now.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
It's important to observe everything.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
They forced me to take drugs.
Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I got into trouble. I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen  a spider  but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
Let's consider again our current information  if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Meaning...???
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
And your only goal is...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
So that...???
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
Shut up!
That's him.
What are you going to do with us?
It's the kidnap woman  the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What's she doing?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that exshrink. This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
To be determined by the proper authorities.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
We want tough minded people. Strong mentally. We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
He's drugged out of his mind! He's completely zoned out.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
You're still a little... disoriented.
We're very close! Because of you!
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
We want you to tell us about last night.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Wake up, Cole.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
No, sir!
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Well?
Uh, what?
Him? You saw that man?
Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.
Women will want to get to know you...
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations  you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole? To that "dying" world'
No, sir! I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet. And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused. You don't know what's real and what's not.
I understand. There'd be no point.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves. We'll get back to you.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. Do you know Nick Cardella?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean 
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a standup guy.
What was the Jewboy's name?
Donowitz, he said.
Yes.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
No.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
Well, you go down Beechwood...
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta roommates?
Exactly roommates.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
How do you know? You been there?
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
You're right. It is.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this! Kandi, you gotta help me.
What can I do?
You gotta hold this for me.
You must be high. Uhhuh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
No way, Jos.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
No.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Read my lips.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
That's bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Preach on, Big D.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy  I would never eat any pussy  but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny. There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit 
 Because it's good!
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch  you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
What was I sayin'?
Rock whores.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry SevenUp.
Pussy love pink rocks.
You OK? That stupid dumbass didn't break your nose, did he?
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy. I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty. He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained. You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience. Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine 
Not a tiny little vial 
But a fuckin' baggie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time 
You're no longer an extra 
Or a bit player 
Or a supporting actor 
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little oneman show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience 
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throatslitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on 
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore 
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it was all over 
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion 
Nicholson and I.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
Suspect's words 
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his twopanny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Like gangbusters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
You do more than try.
You do.
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
He knows.
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows something's up.
We gotta get him outta there.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Okeedokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
That Vietnam movie?
Uhhuh.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.
He'll wear a wire?
We talked him into it.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Step inside.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off. Whenever you're ready.
Where'd you come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
That was very good.
Thank you.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Sure. No problem.
Could we try it now?
Absolutely.
Where'd he come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
What about him?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant breakin on Riverdale.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these breakins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
McTeague.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
You and Robin moved?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place  mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I give up. Who are you?
I'm the AntiChrist. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the howfullofshitIam question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine. Want a Chesterfield?
No.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitchwhore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence 
I've seen him.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
I don't believe you.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
On their honeymoon.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
They didn't tell me.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Sure.
Oh, don't bother. I got one. So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Uhhuh.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
Come again?
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the bloodline for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, greatgrandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a halfnigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
I think there's a SevenUp in there.
Anything stronger? Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
I can, but I don't.
That's about all I ever eat.
Go to the liquor store  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Get a sixpack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
I'm really not very 
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt. Where's a good chicken place around here?
I really don't know.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live? Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
She seems very nice.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk 
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavyduty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this   I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
What do you want from me?
What?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on. Daddy?
What makes you think I could do that?
You were a cop.
What makes you think I would do that?
I'm your son.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
No shit?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Nope.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Who is he?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
I got some money I can give you 
Keep it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around. I love you son.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, businesslike, very little risk.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wiseguy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz 
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffeetable dog shit.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Like that MerchantIvory claptrap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Me too, Boris.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Where'd you go?
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'. Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit. He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Why does he trust you?
We grew up together.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I bullshitted him.
Wanna count your money?
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
No. Not yet.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
That good, huh?
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired  Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
I can see what you mean.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading 
Want an animal cracker?
Yeah, OK.
Leave the gorillas.
 that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars 
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
I grow it on my windowsill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste 
Look, Dick, I don't 
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
What department?
What do you think, eightball?
The police department?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
He trusts you?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
What?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla icecream?
No. No, you don't.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
He wants to talk ya.
Mr. Donowitz? I told you, through Dick. He's in my acting class. About a year. Yeah, he's good. They grew up together. Sure thing.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there. He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
No problems on both counts.
Where's everybody else?
They'll be along.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
I guess so. Follow me.
Elliot.
Yeah?
Get on your knees.
Don't you?
No.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
Say it, goddamn it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. No you're not.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
I'd fuck Elvis.
Really?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
I don't blame you. So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
How 'bout me what?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
What are we gonna see?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Who's Sonny Chiba?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Three kung fu movies.
Clarence?
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Tomorrow.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm a married man.
Get the fuck outta here!
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
What?
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Alabama, could you tell Clar 
Ask him if he got the letter.
Clarence sent a letter?
Has he gotten his mail today?
Money problems?
Now tell him goodbye.
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
You goin' out?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Good for you.
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fuckedinthehead bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
Every word of it.
You're really in love, aren't you?
For the very first time in my life. Do you know what that's like?
This shit can't be real.
It'll get ya high.
It's fuckin' real! It's fuckin' real!
I certainly hope so.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I know.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Tell me.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
This is Drexl's coke?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time 
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Is he big league?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot.
Elliot what?
Elliot Blitzer.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Where?
The zoo.
The zoo. What are you waiting for?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
What's to think about?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Clarence...
Let me handle this.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass. Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything. You got yours?
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
No shit? Dick, that's great!
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Clarence.
Yeah?
Um, nothing, let's go?
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case.
In case of what?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp 
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Do you really mean it?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No. But thanks.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm her husband.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddleeyedJoe to a damnedifIknow.
No thanks.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
Wannabee nigger...
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
What?
Can you live with it?
Live with what?
With that sonofabitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Yeah.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Yeah.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
You'd really do that?
He don't got no right to live.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
I don't blame you.
If I thought I could get away with it 
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
That's why it doesn't come across as asskissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Go on pussyeaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussyeatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fuckedup shit.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit. He eats it.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Take that shit somewhere else.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I heard that.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers' dicks.
Heard that.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast 
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
I'm hip.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some DingDongs.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good. What do you think would taste good?
This should cover it, AuggieDoggie.
Okeedokee, DoggieDaddy.
The forager's back.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
How come?
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Oh, hush up.
Tell him we gotta go.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Don't eat anything.
The letter I sent.
The letter he sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Ya looked through it?
Tell him to look through it.
Get it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Byebye.
Now hang up.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the busdriver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
And here we are.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
The oriental.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Want some Goobers?
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Great movie. Actionpacked!
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Sonny kicks ass.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I took a cab.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Sure. Why not?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
What time is it?
'Bout twelve.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
No. Not particularly. How come?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Would you like to get some pie?
I'd love some pie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What do you want to know?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turnons and turnoffs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Ask me them again. One by one.
What do you do?
I don't remember.
Where are you from.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
What's your favorite color?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
What's your favorite movie star?
Burt Reynolds.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Yes, I would.
Like it?
Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What are your turnons?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Turnoffs?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Do you have a fella?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
How long have you worked here?
Almost four years.
That's a long time.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Do you get paid a lot?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
You bet. How much is that worth?
Four hundred bucks.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
What's that?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
God, Spiderman looks different.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Five.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You know when you sat behind me?
At the movies?
Uhhuh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
I love Janis.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
You mean she got a bad batch?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
So he really loved her?
Uhhuh.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
You didn't do nothing.
Did you hurt yourself? Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
You're a whore?
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know. I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Who?
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
That dazzling imagination.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Who and what is a Drexl?
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uhhuh.
A real live pimp?
Uhhuh.
Is he black?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Is he nice?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
What did he do to Arlene?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
This motherfucker sounds charming!
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douchebag like this in the first place?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total whitecollar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
What?
Will you be my wife?
Yes.
You will?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
I don't believe so.
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible OneArmed Boxer.
I do.
Thank you.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No no no no no no no no no...
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
Where you goin', honey?
I just gotta get somethin'.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
You don't know him 
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Was it him or you?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Is this a joke?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
I think what you did was...
What?
I think what you did...
What?
... was so romantic.
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch Xrated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
How come?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
What?
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
But knowin' me and you gonna be niggerrich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Cancoon.
Why Cancoon?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
That rhymes.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Hello, Alabama.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Wait a minute 
Did you get the letter?
What letter?
What letter?
Gotten your mail yet?
Yeah, my roommate leaves it on the TV.
Yes.
Not yet.
Nope.
Let me speak to Clarence.
He wants to speak with you.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
Knock wood.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
You can't have just one.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This is great, we got cable.
You got that playing basketball?
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now? Your phones are almost certainly tapped. And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a
No. He checked out okay
What do you want me to do?
Find out who this Renquist it.
How?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Who is this woman?
His wife.
His wife? Good. Bring them.
Hello?
Helen? It's Simon. Is it safe to talk?
Yes. Go ahead.
Yes. I suppose so. Where?
The same place. One o'clock. I have to go now. See you tomorrow. Remember, I need you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
I kept looking back, like you taught me. I didn't see anyone.
Okay. It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now. If I get a signal... I may have to leave suddenly.
I understand.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours. I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Where were you? On a... uh, * mission?
Ssshhh! We say Op. Covert * operation. And this one got a little rough.
Worse than Cairo? *
Cairo was a day at the beach next * to this.
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Yes.
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation. See two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running * shootout, ending at the * Marriot...
That was you?!
You recognized my style. See, you're very good. You're a natural at this.
Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
I know. But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Right, of course. I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
It's strange. I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
Were they trying to kill you? *
Three of them. Hardly worth * talking about. Two won't bother * me again.
And you chased one?
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the * risk. It was pretty hairy. I thought he had me, a couple of * times. But I really can't take credit . . .
What is it you want me to do?
Not here. I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again. We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together. For your safety.
You'll call me then?
Yes. Now go.
What's happened?
It's serious. That's all I can * say. Just meet on K Street under * the Key Bridge. At eight sharp. *
To our assignment.
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I'm married!
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married. They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
We're going to Paris?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you. Can you get away? Just for two days.
I don't know. I have to think...
Here. Sit down. Be comfortable.
You see what I mean? That reaction would give us away in a second. Try to relax.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I
Relax. There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Thank you. You saved my life. What's your name?
Helen.
You can call me Simon. You're very brave to do this... You opened it.
I just glances inside.
Who's your little friend?
I'm Helen Tasker. Harry's my husband. And you are?
So now it's Tasker? Not Renquist?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent. He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years
What's going on, Harry?
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions. See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for. Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years. So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Hold that thought.
Like one?
Fuck you.
I said SIT DOWN. Who do you work for?
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Of course. Mrs. Tasker. And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal? Taking dictation?
He said he was an American agent.
What?
Get going!
Uh... well, okay then. You sound terrible. I'll run out right now. Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy. Sure, no problem. Bye.
Boris and Doris?
Go ahead.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
Absolutely.
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet. But it's not enough. If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
And you've got one.
It's killer. Look at me I'm not that much to look at. No really. I can be honest. But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either. Some are.
So what's your angle?
Sorry. Trade secret.
Sure. Set me up and then don't tell me.
Okay, just ask yourself. What do women really want? You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years. Stuck in a rut. They need some release. The promise of adventure. A hint of danger. I create that for them.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time? I couldn't do it.
Well, think of it as playing a role. It's fantasy. You have to work on their dreams. Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Doesn't matter. I like change. You know, constant turnover. As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Exactly. The trick is, you gotta pick your target. They have to be nice little housewife types. Schoolteachers. But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck start a leafblower.
What about the husbands?
Dickless. If they took care of * business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Those idiots.
You working on someone right now?
I always have a couple on the hook. You know. There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog. It's great.
What does she do?
Some kinda legal secretary of something. Married to some boring jerk.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Red hot. Her thighs steam.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
See. You and this car were meant for each other. Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style. Whattya say? Should we start on the paperwork?
Let me think about it. Hold it a day for me?
Yeeaoowww!!
You son of a bitch. Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Wait! You got the wrong guy. My name's Simon. Look, just let me go. There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your
Beat it.
No. Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Hi, honey. How was the flight?
Fine, honey. Stay asleep.
Okay.
I'm late.
Me too.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Yeah. You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
That's fabulous Harry.
Yeah, it was wild.
Uh huh. Okay.
It's not okay. It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Good thinking, honey.
I need you to talk to Dana. The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
I'll handle it.
Hi honey. What's going on? *
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that * you'll be home at eight. I don't * want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
Baby, I said I'd be there. Really. Trust me. Gotta go, honey. Bye bye.
Look, I know you're upset. I'm really sorry, honey. I raced home as quick
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I'm sorry. Thank you for the party.
Yeah. It was great.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
I'll just be a second. So what happened tonight at the office?
I couldn't believe it. I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown
What'd you do, honey?
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable... really wild.
It sounds wild. So now you're a big hero, right? For fixing their system.
Uh huh.
My husband the hero.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They must've just missed me.
They said you had to run out.
Yeah. It was a rush thing. They needed some documents down at the court house. I barely made it.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did is work out okay?
Oh, sure. Fine. I'll get some more gravy.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
I can't, honey. I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
I don't know anything about a faction. I just met Simon... or whatever his name is... a couple of weeks ago. I barely know him.
What did happen?
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Why did you continue to see him?
He needed my help.
Not because you were attracted to him?
No.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Well, maybe a little.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Harry? What can I say about Harry? He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Yeah. I suppose he is.
That's none of your goddamn business! What kind of questions are these?
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate. If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Let me handle this part. Do you mind? Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
And you agreed?
Yes.
Why?
I don't know. I guess I needed something...
What did you need?
I needed to feel alive. I wanted to do something... outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed. To be trusted. To be special.
This Simon. Did you sleep with him?
No.
Let me out of her! Right now!
Answer the question
What?
Do you still love your husband?
Yes.
Louder please.
I love him. I have always loved him and I will always love him. Can I go home, please?
Oh, gee thanks. Mmmm, let me see
Yes or no.
What do you think? Of course yes! What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
No one must know! Especially him. You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing. The security of this nation depends on it. Can you do that?
I think so.
Think carefully. You will be lying to the man you love. The person who trusts you the most.
I can do it!
The code name of your contact will be Boris. Your code name will be
Natasha?
No. Doris.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
What? Oh, the flat tire? Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Allison is sick in bed. I have to go over there, honey.
Sure, hon.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
I'm not wearing any.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Let the hooker go. She's not important.
Harry, be quiet. Let me handle this.
What were you doing there?
You wouldn't believe me.
Harry, what's the matter with you? Tell them the truth. We're married, we have a daughter
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on. You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Then where did I get this?
I'm sorry, honey.
Don't call me honey! You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?! You pig!
What did he give you?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
Yes.
Is it working yet?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are we going to die?
Yup. *
17 years.
My God. Have you had to... have sex with other women in the line of duty?
I don't take those assignments.
What about Juno?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
No. But I wanted to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Looks that way.
What is it?
God, you have great legs.
Harry... snap out of it!
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
What?
Do you still love me?
Yes.
As much as you used to?
No. Much more.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
We must be in the Florida Keys . * . . the Overseas Highway * connects the islands to the mainland.
What are you going to do?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Oh shit.
Wait here. If you have to use this, use it. Don't choke. Okay?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce. He looked like such a dope.
I told the guy I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Not yet. But we'll find him.
Dance?
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Very good. It's sixth century B.C. Do you like the period?
I adore it.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
I'd like that.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
I agree.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
That's right. They want something... dramatic. I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words. And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Those wimps. It's because I use * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. I told you to move those crates an hour ago. Come on guys, let's get going.
Do you like my tomb? The museum * financing fell out, so I thought * your clients might be interested.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Especially in this light. This is the only light they had then, * so I like to study it this way. I love this place. I love all ruins.
Is that why you got into this business?
I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes.
Yes what?
Uh, yes, it is important.
Hello, Harry.
Juno. I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
This is Samir. See if you can guess his specialty.
Oral hygiene?
Not exactly.
You think I care about their * cause? Or yours? Not at all. * See, America is on top now . . * . but so was Rome, once. All * civilizations crumble. One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run? The only important thing is to live well. And... living * well takes money. *
You're damaged goods, lady.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Sure. Say that now.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes sir.
God! You have no idea how much that turns me on. I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Yes, sir.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
But you didn't. Why not?
I don't know. I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
No! Never!
So, it was your first time.
I wasn't cheating!
My husband is a good man.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right? I mean
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time. And I have to get home to my family.
You're not going anywhere.
Switching to subvocal. Gib, you copy?
It's Talkradio. You're on the air.
Harry! Where are you!
In the helicopter.
Harry? HARRY?!
What?
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck. Bring your kid something. You know. The dad thing.
Got it. Nice touch. Okay, pick me up at eight. The debrief is at ten hundred.
What a team. See you at eight.
Yep. Sleep fast.
Thanks dear.
Here, check these out.
Son of a bitch!
What?
Kids. Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
She knows not to steal. I've taught her better than that.
Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen. Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
See, kids now are ten years ahead * of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin
Don't be ridiculous. She's only  how old is she?
Fourteen, Harry.
Right. She's only fourteen.
Uh huh. And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm. I * say even money that physicist on * the bike is boinkin' her. *
No way. Not Dana.
Okay. Okay. Denail ain't just a river in Egypt. She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
Will you just open the door! *
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
I thought you moved out.
Well . . . I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement. Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Harry Tasker. One zero zero two four.
Albert Gibson. Three four nine nine one.
You better watch it. She might file on you for sexual harassment.
In her dreams.
It doesn't mean anything. She buys antiquities for Khaled.
Nope. The art buys are in a separate ledger.
It's all set up... ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist. Okay, reality check. Go.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist. I own a
She's importing stuff from all over the mideast.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
What? It's on the way. She says she's got something for me.
Yeah, right.
Station wagon?
Uh huh. Want me to lose them?
Helen's going to be pissed.
See, that's the problem with terrorists. They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
What's the plan?
Gonna try to get a closer shot of * Beavis & Butthead. *
There's another guy, still in the car.
Stay on him.
Copy that.
And make it fast. My horse is getting tired.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet? Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch 
Okay. Here she comes.
Look at the way the little punk is driving. He's all over the place. Look he hasn't signalled once.
Goddammit! That's outrageous.
So, you wanna play huh? You little
That's it. Get 'im Harry We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Ha! The little prick ditched you! That is so goddamn funny.
Son of a bitch!
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra * fundamentalist. Linked to * numerous carbombings, that cafe * bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year. Major player. *
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
You want me to just hang ?
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
He Helen. Helen it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
She's having an affair.
Congratulations. Welcome to the club.
It can't be. Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
It can't be.
Same thing happened to me with wife two. I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty. I mean empty. She even took the icecube trays from the fridge. What kind of person would think of that?
I still don't believe it.
Relax. Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her. It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a 
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about? We have that.
Helen's phone. Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day. Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps. Now.
Sure, Harry. I'm on it.
Guy's a spook!
Yeah, but for who? *
He could be working her to get to you.
Give me the page.
What are you talking about?
It skips from page nine to eleven. Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
She's still at my house. *
The purse is still at the house.
Goddamnit, Harry. This is our butts. So your life is in the toilet. So your wife is banging a used car salesman. Sure it's humiliating. But be a man here
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Whatya talking? I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe. Clean as a 
What about that time you trashed a sixweek operation because you were busy getting a blowjob?
You know about that?
She's lying.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
She could be telling the truth.
Wait! Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Now what?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker. You must work for us.
Oh shit. Harry... what're you doing?
I'm giving her an assignment. I am offerring you a choice. If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life. If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone. Your like will be destroyed.
We're dead, right? So... where'd you put the transmitter?
In her Walkman. It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
You've reached a new low with this one. I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
Why not? You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is JeanClaude done yet? *
I thought this look like your work.
Let's go. I'll brief you in the air.
You're welcome.
you tell the son of bitch this is Bright Boy Alert. Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert. And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius. Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Get 'em. I'll brief them on the way in.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers. Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah
Here they come.
Any minute now.
It's show time. Don't look at * the flash. Do not look at the flash.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
He's got it.
Sorry.
Faisil. You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Yes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Sorry, sir. Uh... here's what we got.
They call him "The Sand Spider". *
Why?
Probably because it sounds scary. *
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
And this is a little above market * rate for the horizontal bop, even * for a total biscuit like her.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her. Do we know where she is?
Uh huh. Right here in river city.
You're kidding.
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices * here. *
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the * ghost numbers. They were checking out the Renquist front.
Okay. Let's step up the surveillance on her. Put on two more guys.
Immediate roll. Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge. * Vehicle is redandwhite * convertible. You have six minutes.
Roger, One. Rolling.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called. Why weren't you in class today?
He lies! I was there! I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
You seem fine now.
Great! You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady. You never used to lie to me. But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Dana, are you listening to me?
Yeah, Dad.
You know you can always talk to me. Right? Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Okay, Dad.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
I'm not a pumpkin! Okay?!! Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
How was school today?
Fine.
There are going to be some changes Dana. You're going to start following some rules. And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Yeah, right.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Why? So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Unbelievable! Trent told me he wrote it. He's history.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Dad. You just think you know everything, don't you?
Where are you going?
Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Mom, wake up! Dad barely knows we exist.
That's not true, honey
It is true! He doesn't know anything about me. He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something. As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine. But it's not fine. Nothing's fine.
Dinner's in the warmer. Tell your father I may be late.
Where are you going?
Out.
I'm done.
Where are you off to young lady?
I have a book report.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything. He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out. But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
So I guess you didn't get away * for the weekend after all? *
Are you kidding? Harry had to go out of town.
I'm shocked.
Yeah. You know Harry.
You bitch.
Girlfriend, you got a man. You * just have to take control . . . set up the right mood. *
Harry only has two moods: busy... * and asleep.
Then you better do something to * jumpstart that man's motor. You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Helen! It's your mystery man.
Simon? Ohmygod.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Just an hour? You should tell this stud to take more time.
Will you shutup. I should never have told you about him.
Yori... hey...
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during downtime...
That's all going to change, Yori...
How?
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
My quarters.
Why is everything...like this?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
You've grown, big program.
I had to...in the games...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
As long as it gets us out of here
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
Then I owe you some thanks...
What is it?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
We have to get off this beam!
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Nice...
It's something Users do.
Where's Flynn?
New guy...
Another free program off line. What's his User s'posed to do  ?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
What do you think?
Do it!
You think we can make it there?
We have to.
Do you know what he's talking about?
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Thank. you, Master Control.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Strategic Air Command.
Yes, MCP.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark  a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
A User?
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Well, I  it's just  I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Now get this straight, pal  no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their manyears! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together! Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Butwhat if I can't...?
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Wait...I need that...
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
End of line.
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us 
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
We have to talk.
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
So...how's the world of serious science?
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
You're getting out of the business?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Well, great, that's no sweat  I play video games better than anybody.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs  and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Yeah, yeah  that's great.
How 'bout yourself?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Tron...?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Watch it!
Recognizers!
It's all circuits... Must be an input/output component...
The tower, yes  Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself  like what sector you're from?
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ... ...probably Program Assist Routine  well, it sounds like a lovely place.
It grows on you.
Feel what? You okay?
AlanOne...
What's goin' on?
We're inside a Recognizer... You are crazy  stealing a Recognizer 
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us 
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Come here.
Hey... !
Little more juice's all it needs...
A User  in our world?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
A little ... Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
What's wrong with that area?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
There's another beam!
It's too far!
How did you do that, Flynn?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head Are we there yet, Mommy?
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Let's get some power here.
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Why? What are you going to do?
Jump.
But... won't you be derezzed?
Probably.
Flynn... you can't... I
Shhhhh.
Alan!
Where did you hear that name?
Well, isn't it  ?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
What, just the three of us?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
What's that?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
How about over there...that empty memory?
No good...they might block off the old chip. This way.
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
Flynn... Where's Ram?
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Wrote the...?
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a  well, I'm what you guys call a User.
But  if you're a User  then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Then...
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Well  that's how it is for programs, yes, but 
I hate to disappoint you, pal, mostthe time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Stranger and stranger...
We're on our way. AlanOne gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
What about our friend  Sark?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not us, I hope.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Did we make it?
Yes.
Hey... you guys OK?
How about you?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
Yes?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best. Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
Well I want to communicate 
Oh, you want to  hah. I could get myself derezzed justfor letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Dumont... my User has information that could  could make this a free system again.
Hah.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place  and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
Who is your User, program?
AlanOne. He calls me... may I pass?
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Dumont!
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
They may be... derezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Ed, all I'm saying is  if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research 
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy 
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right 
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that 
User requests are what computers are for.
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect  ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore 
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
It can be arranged...
That was uncalledfor.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
No problem, MasterC. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up?
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
Yes. It felt like Flynn.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Cute.
End of line.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
I'm sorry 
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
The Pentagon?
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
Now, wait a minute  I wrote you.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
If you think 
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
You wouldn't dare.
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
That all you can say?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oh. Anything else?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
only yes and no... You're a bit.
For sure...
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
No...
I'm your program?
Right on the money!
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Yes, okay, exactement!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
No, nuhuh, never in a million years!
This town's full o' live ones.
Not a chance.
You said it.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Yes!
Let's get outta here.
Come on in...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yeah...?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime. I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
No, no, I'm sure, but  you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Ok
Beautiful!
Hello, Alan.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Not disintegrating, Alan  digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and... voila.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
They'll start to soon enough.
Yes, won't that be grand  the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
How's it going upstairs?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Did you say Group 7 access?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Did he say why?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Okay, okay...
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.
What for?
To warn him.
Of what?
That Dillinger's on to him.
For what?
For being on to Dillinger.
What  ?
Flynn!
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often 
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
I'm certainly not.
You did break in.
Tried to. Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Are you embezzling?
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey... No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
I don't get it.
You haven't told him?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... ...Space Paranoids.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer  not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented"  the slime didn't even change the names  and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Senior exec.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Dillinger?
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Hi, Alan.
Hi, Flynn.
My dinner.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Want one?
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and  it's running.
I know, I met him.
Your old files  ?
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them  it's all there  look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. You must kill me.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk. Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
No. I will not.
You know I'm right.
Each man's pain is unique.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
Do you?
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Sybok  this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree  or any other God!
I don't understand.. Reveal yourself to me!
Sybok.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sybok, we must find a way...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Borgus Frat.
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Easy, easy, easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
He's not?
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
No, no, no. Scotty  Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition. Or yours.

I must have your starship.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Who are you?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
But I thought Captain Chekov.. I see. Very clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and reraise the shields will take
What are you doing?
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
We must change our course at once.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I trust your message was received?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear. Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
I'm afraid of nothing.
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
I don't control minds. I free them.
Spock... What have you done to my friends?
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No... I didn't.
Now learn something about yourself.
No. I refuse.
Wait! You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Your vision?
Given to me by God. He waits for us on the other side.
You are mad!
Am I? We'll see.
About the ship...
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
No conditions.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Because you, too, must know.
What have I done?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
Spock...
Spock  What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I regret to inform you that the record for freeclimbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
And that is?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Oh, God
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
I don't understand.
I've always known... I'll die alone.
What are you doing?
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Are we leaving, Captain?
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..." Do  do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
The lyrics are  are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in. Doctor, if you please.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Jim.
Yes, Spock?
Life is not a dream.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Spock.
Goodnight, Doctor.
I could use a shower.
Yes.
Not General Korrd.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I cannot be certain.
But he does seem familiar?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
I do not often think of the past.
Who is it he reminds you of?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
What do you mean?
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Why?
He believed the key to selfknowledge was emotion, not logic.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Fascinating.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Damn. Let's go.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Spock.
Yes, Captain?
Be one with the horse.
Yes, Captain.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrdyou tell him.
You must allow us to act.
Let me do something.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Captain, what have I done 
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
If you think it would help.
You stay out of this! Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
You mean he's your brother brother? You made that up!
I did not.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
I gotta sit down.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
There's got to be a way out of this place.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escapeproof.
How do you know?
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
He did have pointed ears.
Is it possible?
Is what possible?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
I am here, Captain.
That's a little vague, Spock 
You're right. I'm a little out of practice. Uh....that's an "s."
A "t."
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
"c."... "k."
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Hmmm?
Uhuh.
It would appear we are too heavy.
It must be all those marsh melons.
Spock... the booster rockets.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Fire the rockets!
Spock.
The emergency channel, open.
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
...mark two.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
Spock... don't.
It's all right, Captain. Proceed.
What is this?
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Spock?
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Not possible. You were never alone.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart Spock?
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is nonoperational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Put it on the screen.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Transporter room. Status.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Go, Sulu.
You told me you could have the ship operational in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Aye, Captain How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
If we could send a distress signal...
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it. Which way to the turbo shaft?
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
It's all I have.
Your pain runs deep.
What do you know of my pain?
Let us explore it together.
Where did you get this power?
The power was within you.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Join my quest.
What is it you seek?
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began  ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
But how?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Can we have it quiet?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
You caught me on my way to the shower.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Oh, please.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Have the Klingons responded?
No, but you can bet they will.
Understood. Kirk out.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
A Federation starship.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
What's going on?
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Shuttle en route.
Position, Bird of Prey?
Closing.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
Raise shields.
But the shuttle
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
I don't have a clue.
Admit it. We're lost.
All right, we're lost. But we're making good time.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Plotting our new course.
New course? You have no authority. What's going on here?
Pavel.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Rescued at last.
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
Qual se tu?
It is I. The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us  but we breached it.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
With a starship!
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
It will be your chariot!
He has his doubts...
You doubt me?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
He doubts me.
No, no, it's not possible.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
The ship....
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
My pain?
It runs deep. Share it with me.
What do you see as your main strengths?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
Homeless people?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie  one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we  me and him  were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right 
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
How's it going with Gail?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
That's fair enough.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Went ballistic?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
So what's it going to be?
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
We go for a walk.
What?
A walk.
But where?
Well, what are you waiting for?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
This had better be good.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Such as?
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
There.
Are you serious?
It's the great outdoors.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
It's fresh air.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Are you serious?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Well, it's up to you.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
The Sick Boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
What's on the menu this evening?
Your favourite dish.
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
Why, thank you.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Stick it on my tab.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
In that case 
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
As you wish.
Great.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sure.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Yeah.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget  Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that 
You Only Live Twice?
Nineteensixtyseven.
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Eh  Ian Fleming?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
OK, so who was it, then?
You can look it up.
Who wrote it?
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
You don't know, do you?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
The park?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual setup.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
What do you mean?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed 
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. 
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
What's wrong, Allison?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Say something, Mark, say something 
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he  you know?
What?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Cut it out.
When are you going to visit him?
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
You're all hear.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Fuck you.
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, nohopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
I can't believe you did that.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
It was my fucking television.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Why?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
What?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester  you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
How much?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. { He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg.  }
So?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
What was your price?
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
That's tough.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
Good luck, Spud.
Cheers.
Now remember 
Yeah.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Right.
But try too hard 
And you might get the fucking job.
Exactly.
Nightmare.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Try this.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Another dab?
Would not say no, would not say no.
Are you getting out much?
No.
Following the game at all?
No.
No. Me Neither.
You take the test?
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Have you got any gear on you?
No, I'm clean.
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Thanks, Mark.
No problem. No problem  easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
Sorry about last night 
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
There's no need.
It's no problem.
No problem for me either. Honestly, it's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Spud, they're my sheets.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather 
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Oh, really?
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto 
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Now?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Fuck, OK.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone fullblown.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Eh? How's that?
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
It's an interesting theory.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What happened?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Thanks.
What's your name?
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
Where's that?
It's where I live.
Great.
What?
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Eh
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
think I left something back at the 
Diane.
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Shut up.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Right. You can't sleep here.
What?
Out.
Come on.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Jesus.
And don't make any noise.
I don't see why not.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Easy for you to say.
Can I see you again?
Certainly not.
What do you want?
Are you clean?
Yes.
Is that a promise, then?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
No.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Well, it isn't.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
Too young for what?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
It's Iggy Pop.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
The point is, you've got to find something new.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Unless you get caught.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
So why have you told me about it?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
What? Steady like?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
Happy birthday.
What do you think  I should be carrying a torch for you?
So, what's he like?
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
Aye, OK, Fr. But the good times couldn't last for ever.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
What?
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Can you not go yourself.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Twothirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Jesus.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty three pounds.
Four kilos. That's what  Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal  like it so much you want to go back again?
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuckups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Did you bring the cards?
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
For four fucking grand? One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
We'll be halfway down the road with the money.
I'd fucking kill you.
I guess you would, Franco.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Twenty thousand.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Ninteen.
For fuck's sake.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her  properly.
Shag her senseless.
No, I don't mean like that  I mean something nice, like, that's all 
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
You've stabbed me, man.
You were in my way.
Did you tell him?
No. On you go.
What?
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Christ.
OK. Same again?
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
I'll be right after you.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back 
What do we do? Okay. Fuckedup Bowman's turning blue. Doctor. We need a doctor.
Your dad's a doctor. Call him 
He's a research doctor. You're dad's a doctor, too 
What kind of research?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon 
It's three a.m. I'm not supposed to be here. I snuck out 
Who are these guys?
Agents who died in the field.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Right. Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants... Who knows? Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us. Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do you mean?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
I don't know. I don't think there's any one person. See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides. Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels. It's very organized.
I just want to be clear about one thing. I used to work for him, but now I work for you. I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you wellversed on an incredible array of issues. The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico. I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me. That's why I can help protect you.
Like you protected Landry?
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very selfdefeating. Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
Hello.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
Salazar's been taken down. He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What? I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Apparently not. Look, it's a shit storm here right now. When are you coming back? I don't know what to tell people any more.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now. Are you all right?
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process. Not only physical, but also psychological.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
That would be very helpful to me. Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico. I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year. But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force. We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand? What is your policy for treating addiction?
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
She's not at that place you sent her?
She snuck away. And we haven't seen her. She hasn't come home.
Oh, man 
She hasn't called you?
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through. I'm surprised she hasn't called.
Can you tell me anything? Do you have any ideas?
I don't know what to say.
I'm not the police. I don't care about experimentation. She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents 
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?
The West End. We buy it off the streets. I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different 
You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You're a cocky seventeen yearold and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away. And neither does she.
Hey man, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help.
You want to help? Stay the fuck away from her.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Hey man, back the fuck up. To this place. What's that shit? Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs? You know where I can get drugs? What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities? If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man. The product's marked up three hundred percent. You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day. You think white people would still be going to law school?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
This is a business. Get the fuck outta here.
I need to find my daughter. I'll pay you.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I have money 
I got money.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars. I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
The busiest land border crossing in the world. Over fortyone thousand vehicles per day, twentytwo thousand pedestrians on foot. I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Any idea how much?
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them. I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractortrailers. At least a halfdozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
What do you look for?
We ask questions and measure the answers. When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look. Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year. Now it's almost double. Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Any way we can do it better?
Sure. More money in intelligence on their side of the border. So we have a better idea who we're looking for. More dogs. More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x ray machines to run the trucks through. Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do. But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now. In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars. What does that tell you?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
Right. But, that's not the biggest problem. One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else. It doesn't smell like coke. It doesn't look like coke. And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test. It could be anything. Maybe it's already happening. I mean, how would we know?
My work keeps me young.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
The worst serial killer in history  who? Gacy  right? Killed forty two people. Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega is a criminal.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S. Government. So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
I'm aware of that.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
It could mean that, yes.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
It's possible.
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
What's your name?
Javier Rodriguez.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
One question. How did you find about this?
An informant.
What is the name of your informant?
It was an anonymous tip.
That's your past. I want to talk about your future. Would you be willing to do something for me?
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing. Nothing really.
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
Everybody has a weakness.
You watch and learn. I earn his trust. Then more pain. Then I appear with kindness. Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
But will he be housetrained?
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors. Then we get them and they too will give us names. And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
Somewhere safe.
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
No.
It's important that we work together. Mexico. America. One hand washing the other.
We agree.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
This is a very different proposition.
You should feel good about this.
I feel like a traitor.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Yeah.
What's he doing up here?
I don't know. Something.
Relax. If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people. They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
She's nosy. She hears me on the telephone.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again. Everything's back to normal.
Please. Filing a report will not help you find your car.
The police won't find your car.
This is fucking crazy. Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission. Do you know who Frankie Flowers is? He's a psychocokehead hitman. A faggot. He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him. And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
A group of us are going out tonight.
Who?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban 
Your new friends.
Yeah. It should be fun. You wanna come?
Not this time.
It's no problem. I was just with everybody we work with.
Oh, really. General Salazar was there?
No, but a lot of other people. You should come. You should come out with us.
Go home. Get cleaned up. Get to work. Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind. Don't fuck this up.
Madrigal's alive.
What?
Porfirio Madrigal is not dead. I just saw him.
Javi! Come on. Don't pull this you don't care bullshit. This is incredible information. It must be. Javi 
We keep our mouths shut.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five yearold son. I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
No, this is not possible. And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I hear these stories. Your husband in jail. His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala. Your route is compromised. Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I don't think you're going to do that.
You don't? Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children. Are you aware of this?
I don't know. Perhaps I remember something.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo. That's nothing new.
Not in...
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is highimpact, pressuremolded cocaine. Odorless. Undetectable by dogs. Undetectable by anyone.
I don't believe you.
You first.
I'm six months pregnant. I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
That's good coke.
It should be... It's yours. I want our debt forgiven. I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States. And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
Take this back with you. Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
You will help me with my other problem.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego. And we have a deal.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes. Has he eaten?
I don't know, sir.
You will dine with me from now on.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do? Rent a Huey? Have an airlift? It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right? How many peasants would that take? A line stretching from here to Mexico City 
Nobody said shit, Eduardo 
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo? You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
I am a legitimate business. Fishing boats. Tuna. Check it out. Tax records, everything 
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You can't visit me here. I want my lawyer.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
One chance here, Eduardo. Make us believe you got a boss. No boss, it's all on you.
It's a death sentence. I'll never make it to the trial.
We can protect you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
So you pay off our customs officials?
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA. Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search. The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds. We hire drivers with nothing to lose. Then we throw a lot of product at the problem. Some get stopped. Enough get through. It's not difficult.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
I got greedy. I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off. That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
He hired you. That was a mistake.
Carl and I were friends from childhood. He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
This is ridiculous. Why is there no elevator?
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
That thought makes me feel awful.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened? That my drugs had gone through. What would have been the harm? A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive. We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
You're breaking my heart.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are. This food tastes like shit.
So go shower already.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them. You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
Yes.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You may speak.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You're kidding. Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns. You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When will you do it?
I don't know. Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl. The security is very tight. There may not be a way.
There's always a way. If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
They're going to walk right past me.
What are you? A mouse? Get out of the car and do it. This is your chance.
I'll put this in the back.
No 
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Not Tiger Woods.
Especially Tiger Woods. ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
David 
We're playing!
Women's room, stall two. Should we stop for icecream?
Yeah!
What do you think it is?
Depends who it's from.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff. Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. Definitely third category.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Depends on the state.
Arizona.
Medicinal marijuana initiative. Or am I being cynical?
No telltales. Nothing to read. Not touching my face. Not even blinking. No giveaways. How're you feeling?
I feel good.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Nope.
Chill out 
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick. Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business. We got you.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
Who do you work for?
They're whispering. I can't hear them, but I know it. I smell conspiracy. I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
She ain't in on it.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You want to make a wager on this?
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
Maradona is a cokehead. Hand of God, my ass. We're wasting our time here.
He won. He was a winner. That bothers you.
Winners don't do coke. Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Are you getting this on tape?
I love my job. I love it. The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
What do we do?
I don't know.
What do you think she wants?
She's your girlfriend. Open it, talk about your kids.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life. Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
What are you doing?
Just watch.
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
What is this, like freebase?
Not like. It is.
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm. Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you 
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Are you kidding... I'm staying with you 
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor 
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day? He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons 
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind 
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom 
Then here's a little bump.
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
I think so. If she didn't she should have. I've only got maybe an hour. Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Why? Nobody's there.
...How old are you?
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Do you work?
I volunteer. I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
In school?
Cincinnati Country Day.
Private?
Yeah.
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's. All A's.
You do? What else you do?
I'm a National Merit Finalist. I'm on the HiQ team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club. I'm a Thespian. I'm VicePresident of my class. I'm on the volleyball team.
What's it like? Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Fine  legalization. Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today. The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions. The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy. Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
How long's the job?
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Where is it? Where are the drugs? Where are they?
Fuck you. I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Like I give a fuck.
What is wrong with you? What? You're going away. You're getting help somewhere.
You can't make me.
Oh, yes I can.
Hi.
Hi.
What's up?
Just watching you.
I got that. How was your day?
You all right?
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How's David?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Helena 
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents. I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you 
How? Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home? Do you have any idea what is happening out here? Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien. Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging. Nobody will help us. Nobody will take us in. Nobody wants anything to do with us. So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me. Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Helena 
Tell me what to do, Carl. I need guidance, not a fucking platitude. I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with. I won't do it. I want our life back.
Did you meet the President?
Honey, your father knows the President.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
That makes mom the Czarina. I'm a Czarette. Like Anastasia.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Caroline 
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Did you tell Dad?
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
What do you think?
He didn't hang around us. He's like one of those hippie kids. I'm not part of that group. It was a party in all these rooms. His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do? I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
He's a friend. He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation. He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive. We didn't know what else to do. It wasn't my pot.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise. Superfund is just one of those words. People stop paying attention.
That's frustrating.
It's so frustrating.
I think she's lying.
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit. School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly. Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments. I tried 
Stop. You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
This is different.
Why?
To begin with, she's only sixteen yearsold.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own. We have to allow her space 
Space for what? To O.D. like that other kid? I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents. Because it isn't. Correct?
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
How long have you known?
Six months. I found some marijuana, that's all. And a little pipe about two inches long. I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank 
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me. As a parent.
She asked me not to.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar. It's this General, Salazar. At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
You might want to pencil in a little facetime with your daughter.
Barbara 
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Look, I'm as worried as you are 
No, I don't think so. Leave me alone, give me money. That's what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Yeah, well, she has a way of self medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day. That's different.
Oh, it is?
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Should we bring the police into this?
No, not yet.
About the other night, I'm sorry.
Me, too.
God, I don't get it. Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child? Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
I don't know.
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
Where are you going?
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
It's Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.
Carl, I'm running late. I'm coming right now 
Don't bother.
What?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I was just waiting for the right time.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything else.
You had it all figured out. You move into my house. You raise my kids. You sleep with my wife. It was a good plan, Arnie.
Carl, that's insane.
So my wife is lying?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed. I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Carl 
Goodbye Arnie.
Helena, I'm so sorry 
Arnie, thank God.
I understand. You're upset. You want to know what's going on. That's good.
Why are you talking like that?
Listen to me carefully. First of all, Carl isn't here. DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow. So here you're wasting your time. Are you with me?
Good. From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be taperecorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Got it? Good. Do not discuss anything over the telephone. Do not talk to the neighbors. Stay out of your yard.
What is he being charged with?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here. I want you to go home and relax the best you can. Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard. I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Of course he is. I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered... How am I supposed to survive? I'm giving birth in three months. How do I get through this?
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl. We get Adler and we beat this thing.
How much do I pay him?
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
This place is swept twice a day. I learned that in Miami in '85. Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wackamole. Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here. And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.
Please. Tell me who Carl sells to.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people. Only Carl knows who they are. That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them. They don't know Ruiz. Church and State.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate 
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news? Isn't there something positive you could say.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out. I'm not very adept at being on my own. I've always had a man in my life. Always.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere. I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debtridden, thirtytwo yearold mother whose exhusband is being compared to Pablo Escobar. And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
Have you gone crazy? You are not Carl. You aren't as good as Carl. They are moving the trial to a high security location. The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
Helena, please. This is out of your hands.
I know I made things worse. I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you. Something only you can help me with.
Helena 
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I can't do that.
Did you get it?
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that? You've compromised me and our relationship 
It's the same stuff? From the rainy day stash?
It's the same. What happened to what they gave you?
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
He's right. They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Anna. What's wrong? What do you want?
I can't find Manolo.
He's not here.
He never came home last night. Was he with you?
No.
What? What is it?
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Why does he need money?
He has debts. He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
Nine thousand dollars.
What is he planning on telling them?
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice. He did a great thing for Tijuana. He did a great thing for Mexico.
I want to believe you. I really do.
You will believe me, because it's true.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you. Consider it gone away. She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession. Easy to make it disappear. For you, poof, it's gone.
One thing bothers me... That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him. Serious amounts. He's lucky he lived. So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I don't know what you mean.
I mean, did you ask her? What kind of drugs has she tried?
I... I don't really know.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
I'm Melanie.
You're late for breakfast.
Did you do this?
Victoria 
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys. Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
You're well built; how old are you?
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
It's all right, Finn.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas  '
Storms?
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Juliet who?
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie 
But you're Irish!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
You'll put your clothes here.
There's no mirror.
There's not.
I can manage.
Excuse me.
He's a pyjama case, really.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I like plaits.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I did like the music.
I carried you up to your bed.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
Is there anything else I should know about him?
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
She got away.
He made that. In his off hours.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Didn't you know he made things?
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I want to go home.
Home is where the heart is.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Get away from me...
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells. Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Is that all?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot. If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Go away.
What did I do wrong?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Do what? Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Who's there?
Let me in.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Well ... yes. All right. But 
Ah, come on now!
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Finn 
I'm cold.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I finished it off.
You did what?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Can you move over a wee bit?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Stop it!
I've got a present for you...
Finn ...
In my pocket.
Reprieve.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
H'm?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
It was only a mouthful!
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Did you now.
Surely she is older?
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
How long has 
All the time.
I already lost everything once.
So did I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
So had I.
Everything is gone, now.
Nothing is left but us.
Hey, Slinky?
Right here, Woody!
I'm red this time.
No, Slink 
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Bad news?!
Shhhhh!!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Got it.
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Uhhhh...nothing! Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all. Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose. It's just a mistake.
Heh, heh, heh! Golly bob howdy 
Oh, shut up! In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Woody?!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz  Buzz?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
See? It is Buzz. Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Woody! Speed up!
Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
Slink! Hang on!
Yessss! Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Uhoh.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl. You'll blow up. I know you're tired! I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
This is ludicrous.
SID +++$+++
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Sid!!!
Reach for the sky!!
Huh?
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
What?!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
It's busted.
Wwwwe?
That's right. Your toys.
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir! No Sir!
Okay, thank you. At ease.
Sargent. Establish a recon post downstairs. Code red. You know what to do.
Yes SIR!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Last present!
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame! Repeat! Battleship  Battleship, the boardgame!
Mission accomplished. Well done, men. Pack it up, we're going home.
So did I tell ya? Huh? Nothing to worry about.
There.
Juvenile intrusion! Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Andy's coming, everybody! Back to your places. Hurry!
Buzz. Buzz Lightyear. You are not worried, are you?
I can't quite make out 
They're getting bigger.
Wait! There's a nice little one over there!
What the heck is up there?
Woody? Who's up there with you?
It's Sid!
I thought he was at summer camp!
We believe you, Woody. Right, Rex?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
It's too short! We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel.
I got it, Woody!
He got it, Woody!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Yes! Yes! We promise!
Okay, save your batteries!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best. C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Ha ha. That's very funny, Buzz. This is serious!!
Hey, Woody!? Where'd ya go?
Hi ya, fellas. To infinity and beyond!
Hey look! It's Buzz!
Yeah, hey Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret bestfriends hand shake. Gimme five, man!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
A lunchbox?!
A lunchbox...?!
Laserenvy.
All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy 
Yeah. Like the attic. Heh, heh...
Alright! That's it!
Who is it this time?
I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait a minute. You  you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you backstabbin' murderer!
Now, it was an accident! Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Good going, Slink! Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Wait! Wait! I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here?
No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me!
You are a liar!
No, I'm not! Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?!
Nothing.
No! No, no, no, no!
You murdering dog!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Save it for the jury. I hope Sid pulls your voicebox out, ya creep!
No! No! Don't leave! Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
No wait! You don't understand! Buzz is out there! We've gotta help him!!
Toss 'im overboard!
No, no, no, wait!
Oh, no!
Oh, ya big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Outta my way! Here I come, here I come 
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Have you been replaced?
Oh, really? I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not actually from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
That ain't no happy child.
He tortures toys  just for fun.
Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Aaaaaah!
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry. It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
What?
Did I get my package in the mail?
I dunno.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Look! Janie!
Hey!!
She's sick!
No she's NOT 
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
NOOO... Don't touch her! NO!
Sid, give her back! Give her back now! I'm telling!
Patient is... ...preeepped.
MOM!! MOM!!
She's lying! Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, boy. Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
I can't see a thing!
Hey, watch it!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Let's string him up by his pull string!
I got dibs on his hat!
B3.
Miss. G6.
Ohhh! You sunk it!
Hehheh.
Are you peeking?
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose. C'mon!
How 'bout three out of five?
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Murderer!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Stay calm, everyone!!
No, no! Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
What's with him?
Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly!
Hi!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Something's screwy here.
So, you see? We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz? You bet. Gimme a hug.
Hellooo...
HOYAAAHH!!!
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's 
Watch yourself!!
Yes. They're Andy's toys.
Alright, everyone. You're clear to come up.
Toy?
TOY. Toy.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly 
Excuse me.
They are a terilliumcarbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
Can!
Can't! Can't! Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone!
Why, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
That wasn't flying! That was falling with style!
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?!
And another thing. Stop with this spaceman thing. It's getting on my nerves.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys! Look! It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no... Buzz, look! An alien!
Where?
What's going on?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why. Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
No! No, that's Scud, you idiot!
THAT is Sid!
You mean that happy child?
I could have stopped him.
Buzz, I would love to see you try. 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Buzz!! Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Trouble?! Where?!
Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Right? Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh. Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.
According to my navacomputer, the 
Shut up! Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
My fault?! If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place 
Oh, yeah? Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me 
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
WHAT?!! What are you talking about?!
Buzz! Buzz, come back!
Go away.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Uhhuh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Ow! Watch where you're going!
Sorry.
Wait a minute! No Buzz! This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Where is it? I don't see the 
Spaceship.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I was 
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this 
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport 
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
I'll tell you what's  AAAAH!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick!
Shield your eyes!
It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours 
Oh, you idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action!
Get away! Hoocha! Hoocha!
Hey!! Hey! How are you doing that? Stop that!
Back! Back, you savages! Back!
Woody, stop it!!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Another stunt like that, cowboy  you're going to get us killed.
Don't tell me what to do!
Shhh!
What happened to you?
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy... ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Don't you get it?! You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Shhhhh!! Quiet, Buzz.
Look at me! I can't even fly out of a window!
But  the hat looked good. Tell me the hat looked good! The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, this way!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Oh, come on, Buzz. I...Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.
I can't help. I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey  wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Yeah, right.
No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY! You are HIS toy.
But why would Andy want me?
Why would Andy want you?! Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear. Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that  that whoosh thing  you are a COOL toy.
Buzz!! What are you doing? I thought you were 
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Yes Sir!
Woody! It's the moving van.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Shhhhhhh!
What?!
It's ok. Everything's under control.
Nice work, fellahs. Good job. Comin' out of the ground  what a touch! That was a stroke of genius.
Woody!
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it! Take care of Andy for me!
NOOOOOOO!!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Look out!!
Great!
Woody! The rocket!
The match!
Woody?! What are you doing?
Hold still, Buzz!
Haha!!
You did it! Next stop. Andy.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Not today!
Hey, Buzz!! You're flying!!
This isn't flying. This is falling  with style!
Ha ha!! To Infinity and Beyond!!
Uh, Buzz?! We missed the truck!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Me? No, no, no, no... Are you?
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Aach!  Oh, hi, Bo.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey  it was nothing.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Well sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Uh, let what? I don't  Uh, what do you mean? Who?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
What are you doing over there?
It's a long story, Bo. I'll explain later. Here, catch this!
We're almost there.
Rocky! The ramp!
Whoooooah! Oh! Bo! There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Mmhmmmmm.
Wow! Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yeah!
Now go get Molly. Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Okay.
Come on down, guys. It's time for games! We've got prizes!
Oh, yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry. What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Pizza Planet?! Oh, cool!
Can I bring some toys?
You can bring ONE toy...
Just one?
Mom! Do you know where Buzz is?
No, I haven't seen him.
Andy! I'm heading out the door.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon!
Okay...
I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Can I help pump the gas?
Sure! I'll even let you drive.
Yeah?!
Yeah  when you're sixteen.
Yuk, yuk, yuk  funny, Mom.
Next stop...
Pizza Planet! Yeah!!!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
But what if we leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Bye, house.
Hey! Wow!
What? What is it?
Woody! Buzz!
Oh, great, you found them. Where were they?
Here! In the car!
See? Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Which one can I open first?
Let's let Molly open one.
How are you?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
It is so considerate of you.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
What are you doing?
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I was just trying to make conversation.
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
You know the man next door is near death.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
When did you talk to Harry?
Don't shout!
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since buttonup shoes went out.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you  you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
What must I do?
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil. And evil is a thing you work at.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
What's a toby?
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
Did you have your child at home?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Country people got so many strange ways,
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
My mother passed on years ago.
None of your business.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Is this your house?
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I already have, my dear.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
That's nice.
Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't. You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
You should go back and rest.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
I have someone I want you to meet.
I'll be right there.
Harry, you know everything.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
What's the problem here?
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
How is everybody?
Tolerable well.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Let me get you a cup?
Only if you can spare it.
How is he doing?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Good afternoon to you.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You must have done something to her.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Hattie is a different person now.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
You invited me.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
Man, act like this is your home.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Good morning.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Well, I would appreciate that.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways... ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you. It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what? I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Your feet are cold.
Go back to sleep.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You all act like two roosters.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Hush.
You're always taking his side.
Hush.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
It would be nice.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it. Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
I'm worn out.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I will appreciate that.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
What, are you having another party?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
Since this morning.
What happened to your hand?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
What did you put on it?
It's healing now.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
It's only a tale.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Not anymore, not in the city.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets. I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
What is that?
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
It is just a regular card.
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. What would you give to be rich?
Who is it?
Babe Brother.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
He will be alright.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
What for?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I'm busy.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough. You sit right there with your no manners self.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
How old are you?
Why don't you come in for a while?
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Why does he always pick on me?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Why in the h...
You okay?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
Like a veil has been lifted?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Like muddy waters?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
You were in hell?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Do you think you won?
It was nip and tuck.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You always got something to say.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Maybe I can get down there next week.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either halfass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I ought to break your damn neck.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
What is it, noontime?
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
That's a lie.
I pay my own way.
Since when?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
What did your wife get her?
We got the same thing.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Junior spends time with his child.
Oh here we go with that.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
Yes.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
They're too big.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
What about ID's?
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Oh, no.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
I don't know. He's not in the database 
What's in the box, General? What's in the box???
Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Abort the cruise.
Soviet SB9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Will the cruise set it off?
Yes.
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
You disappoint me, Number Three.
Please sir. Please 
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Is the helicopter ready?
Fueled and waiting.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
It's a trick! After him. They're in the south stairwell!
Get more men up there!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
I should have hired this man. Get somebody up there!
 Built to withstand a nuclear blast. Are they alive?
Yes. Shall we kill them?
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan. Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
What the hell is going on?
It's Bond!
Kill him! Finish it!
That was too close.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Excellent.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Approaching the first gate.
Start the grinders.
Bore through. ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond. They're wrong. Revenge is the best revenge.
Entering the main tunnel  ten minutes to target 
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
You have to leave 
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island  a barren, lifeless rock  and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization. And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock. The gold is merely reparations  payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
You come with me  You stay here.
What is HE doing here?
I see you two have met.
Obviously, the British government denies all of this 
 I told you! He was there! 
 But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
He brought that up from the wreck.
...I see.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story. Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
How sweet.
My timing always was lousy.
Damn. It's doing it again.
What's wrong?
About every ninety seconds, the auto pilot jogs us to the west.
The backup does the same thing.
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
How is it now?
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
A dead head. Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel  from the logging camps on Sumatra  but they don't usually float this far west. Muncy! Engines to half!
Ayeaye sir. Engines to half.
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch 
Pencil it in for the next trip 
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story 
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write 
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
No 
The Queen invited you to dinner 
Yes 
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Excellent.
Who's in charge here?
I am. What do you want?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Who's Wade?
What's your name?
Captain Morton.
My name is Sidney Winch, and 
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
I was an attorney!
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession. Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No.
You leave me no alternative.
You won't get away with this!
Goodday, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up  before you run aground.
... And what do you call these?
Jashwa tsway. These are lips.
Indeed they are. Deadly little things.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
Stop it!
I was just getting to the interesting part!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Remind me.
Sakwa!
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Mandarin. You jerk. I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Thank you Colonel Everhart. 007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Yes, M.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Of course. Minister Johnstone.
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
Only what I read in the newspapers.
 Along with Tomorrow  the first worldwide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. 
'Able to topple governments with a single story'  as he says in his press.
... What's Harmsway done?
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
Of course.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere  but it did earn MI6 a rather powerful enemy 
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
I understand.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Sorry I'm late 
Actually, you're just in time. Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
I have an excellent teacher. 'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Sabotage?
A threethousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
Bourbon. Neat.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
 And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Have we met?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond.
Sidney Winch.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another for you?
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Boyfriend?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Pity. Bring him whatever he wants.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond? Wait  don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in  London?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I'll keep that in mind.
I see my date is here. And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Nice to run into you again.
Let's not make it a habit.
 Shut up!
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life... ...But she won't kill us.
No?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
So charming! So suave! Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope so.
I hope you'll be gentle.
Think about mom.
And what do you call this?
 The family jewels?
If I were you 
 You're not.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Thank you. "Now hear this: Drop dead."
Why don't we just take these 
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
... Do you have a gun?
What?
You heard me. A gun? I left mine in the car.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II. And thanks to your little show and tell   giving him the evidence  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
You are seriously deranged.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
This has got to be a mistake.
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Wait here.
No. I'm going with you.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
My father left me the business.
Not a lot of difference.
What do you mean?
What the hell does that do?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Down?
Up.
What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
Trust me.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Are you listening to me?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
... We have time for that?
Sometimes you just have to 
Don't say it.
Is this  like  a normal day for you?
It's a lousy job, but  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
You insist on calling all the shots. And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
If not?
We blast through.
Sleep well?
Next time, I do the driving.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
I didn't say when I want to die 
... Yes???
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
... Yes?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. Onethird of that gold is mine.
And number two?
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
And when might that be?
Now.
Interesting presentation.
Interesting video tape.
They point, I shoot.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Of course.
... Does this do anything?
Depends what number you write.
Married?
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
I didn't think so.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Thanks. Take care 
You too.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
That's reassuring.
Hey  the world is my office.
Let's take a look at the body.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Step into my office.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body  find where the ship sank. Where did you get the boat?
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok. Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
I think I've just seen my next future exwife.
Not if you kill us first  unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred  What happened?
He tied one on.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Wait a minute  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
I got you covered.
That's reassuring.
Sidney Winch, meet 
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat 
Where to now, Jimbo?
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and 
Come on. I know better than that 
It must do something.
Well... If you insist.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
How is old Q?
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Big game fishing. Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes 
Not from forty feet.
... Shoelaces?
Plastique explosive shoelaces. Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Moving along  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader  anywhere  you're in.
Does it work on cash machines?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I see...
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
I believe Q's exact words were: "Hopefully, nothing."
His newspapers?
Occasionally, yes. British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an exKGB agent turned illegalarms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a longtime friend of the people. If you believe what you read in the papers.
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway  Sir Elliot Harmsway  is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong  and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Political considerations?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing. In fact, I was never here.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Is that any way to say hello?
I thought your specialty was goodbye.
Oh, James. I've missed you 
Is this another one of your games?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Nothing.
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
No! He's crazy  he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong  but you've got to protect me. I know you still love 
Do you feel better now?
Do you?
What about the uranium?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Shhhhh...
Just hold me.
Paris 
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image. You've got to protect me!
Just  say it. Say it just once.
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Yes 
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Wait a minute 
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer  and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some halfassed CIA cowboy  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing: There's no gold down there.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
I know what I saw 
Q! How are you?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency 
That hardly makes up for the imposition. Now, for what I hope will be the very last time  pay attention, 007. First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog ical influences here, likely vector ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship. Next, your new personal communicator. Picturephone, fax, beeper.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next 
Your new car.
 Four wheel drive?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road. All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse  Stop that! Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue 
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Tsi tien, Chienpenny.
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But 
 We all want what we can't have?
Not all of us, 007.
What  no lust for adventure?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience  that when we get what we want  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times  Torture them.
I'm sorry.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles offcourse that night. Captain blamed the autopilot; I suspected he was drunk  until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Did you test the autopilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong. My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer  Silicon Dragon.'
I appreciate your time 
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Where can I find him?
Him? He, is a she  at the bar.
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects... Especially one with such distinguished friends.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond. Darling! Come here. I want you to meet my wife.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton. It's deadlier than uranium.
We'll see about that.
How did you get this number?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency  and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information. Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I'm on my way.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Sir Elliot.
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men... Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
I see.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
I can feel your pain.
By the way  what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Sightseeing.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle  the Earl of Aberdeen  negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. His soninlaw  George Harmsway  made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai... His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper. It was a city of unlimited possibility.
So why did you leave?
Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese takeover, who knows what can happen tomorrow? In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but... I turned it into this
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond. Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions: News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers: 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels  in 35 languages.
And still not a thing to watch.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
...Words to live by?
Your choice. Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet  about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
Briefly.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.' ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
...And what's that, my dear?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to 
I'm sure they will.
Goodbye, Mister Bond.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain. Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium 
 Instant meltdown.
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
What about the gold?
I'd rather die alone.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour. For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago 
Excuse me, but  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred  and the need for secrecy  I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI6. This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Admiral, are you suggesting 
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing 
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA. ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a winesniffing, skirtchasing playboy spy?'
 I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin?
But 
 Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle. Are we in agreement?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
It's too late 
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
What about all these saloons?
Ah, now that's the real mother Lode in Tombstone. Up and down Allen Street, fullblast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist. All except the Oriental. On Account of the element. Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days. Regular slaughter house. Highrollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son. Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Yeah, and dangerous.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card
None of my business, Fred.
Alliegirl...And Louisa! You're So lovely. I'm at your feet, Darlin'. Just at your feet. Guess it's only right. Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
But she doted on the frowner
Look at that. Busted. Brand new Money Ward, too. 33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch. 'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels. Want to thank you For that, Wyatt. All your doin'.
We're gonna do it, boys. Gonna Get ours. Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Well that's your problem. Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Hit a streak when we left. Him And Kate.
Look pretty rough.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Well we're off and running. Just Acquired us a quarterinterest in The game at the Oriental.
Acquired?
So to speak.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Better go with 'em, honey. Here's Where I leave you.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything sidetrack you.
I know, I need a keeper.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money. Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings. Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
I can't hardly believe it. It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt. We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Kinda, actually, yeah. I gotta admit.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt. I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face. I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture. That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Virgil, please. Don't do this to me.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt. It's
Nothing to do with me? I'm your Brother for Christ's sake. God, I Don't believe this. Talk to him, will you? Or hit him. Oh no, don't tell me...
Maybe I jumped the gun. Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted. You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business. Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em. Not If there's money in it.
You are the one, Wyatt. You sure are.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne. Now there's six Of 'em. This is like a bad dream.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right. Just the Same, though... Guess you better swear me in.
Here they are again. Look at 'em.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor. You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
All right, Virge, your call. But Give Doc the shotgun. They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up. Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble. And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Look at 'em all. They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Getting late. Guess I'll turn in.
Bundle up, Virge. Cold out there.
Virgil?
Wyatt...
Easy, gents. Private affair... Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Jack...
Way ahead of you, Wyatt. You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan. Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
They're nothing. They're nobody. I want the Cowboys. All of 'em. I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served. That means we got the Cowboys without quarter. The Black flag, brother. No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
500... Year's wages. And I never even saw a horse like that.
Talked it over. We decided we Don't need the money. Took out 13 Dollars each, though. Federal Posseman's fee. That all right?
Sure...
We should get moving.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair! Somethin' on your mind?
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
That a fact?

So what about you Cowboys anyway?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand. Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there? Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair. I Don't preach and I don't judge. I Ain't no dogcatcher.

You wanted to talk?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
That what you got me up here for?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother. Come back, no hard Feelings.
Forget it, Ringo.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind? You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
'Least they don't scare women.
You're the boss. One thing, though.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any
Mattie, they're here! Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie. Or even Mrs. Earp if you Prefer.
Come up to the fire, honey.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
They're just lonely is all. Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
You get lonely?
No, stay. Please stay with me.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Oh, all right.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now. I guess I could stay a little while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
No really, I can stay a while.
Just go. It's all right. Wyatt, Really. Work well.
All right, well, good night.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
I know what I'm doing. Where have You been?
Out ridin'. So... how you doin'?
I don't know. I'm all right.
Really? You sure?
Sure I'm sure. What is this?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on. And we could Stay on the move, you know? Just Keep going, see the world. Live On room service the rest of our Lives. How'd that be?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Just thinkin' out loud. Forget it.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Mattie. What about this?
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Look, Mattie, I know you're
You know nothing. What you don't Know would fill a book. Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most. You're never Yourself, you never relax. Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself. Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh. But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt. I get so cold. What's between you and that Jew woman?
All right, look. I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie. I can, I swear.
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you? Right out loud so I can hear? Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt? Will you do that?
What can I get you?
Let me have one of those cigars. Kinda nice in here. You run it?
Milt Joyce, owneroperator.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
You see that bird at the faro Table? That's Johnny Tyler. He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the Highclass play. Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out. They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
We've never actually met. My Name's
Wyatt Earp, I know. I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet. This is fortuitous. That Means lucky.
I know what it means.
What is it?
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Oh... Now she's starting. How do they know?
They know. It's the scent. We Better split 'em up.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
That was lovely!
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Fun though, wasn't it?
You'd die for fun?
Wouldn't you? You're laughing! I Was sure you never laughed.
I laugh sometimes
Yes, but how often? Tell me, are You happy?
Am I happy? I don't know. Happy As the next man, I guess. I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
You're a little touchy about it.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all. Am I Happy? Are you happy?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored. That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
What about her?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Where do you get these questions?
Just answer.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Doesn't suit you.
How would you know?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids. That suits Me right down to the ground. In Fact, that's my idea of heaven. All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Room service.
See? You're laughing again. But That's what I want. Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun. Forever. That's my idea Of heaven. Need someone to share It with, though.
You mean Behan? Then why are you with him?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming. He's all right. For Now. Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten. I can't help it. I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
The way you talk. Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live. I'm a woman, I like men. If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady. At least I'm honest.
Well you're different, no arguing That. But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
What's wrong?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense. I almost can't look at You. Like it hurts.
I know, me too. What should we do About it?
You know this is adultery. You Burn in hell for that.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Fortuitous even.
And I don't even know your full name.
Easy to fix. Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I hate Sadie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Always?
Getting late. We better get back.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot. I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
You feel bad about this? About me?
I didn't mean it that way.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me. I know Things, Wyatt. Sweet things. I Could make you so happy.
I can't, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Wyatt...
Sorry about your friend. And I'm sorry about...
I forgave you the moment you said it.
You did. Well... thank you.
I have to go.
Wait!
Wyatt! My God...
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies? It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
I have nothing left. I have Nothing to give you. I have no Pride, no dignity, no money. I Don't even know how we'll make a Living. But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Don't worry, Wyatt. My family's rich.
There they go. Look kinda like preachers.
Yeah. Or undertakers.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Not so sure. Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in. Should've held out for more money.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
How is he?
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
Never even heard of anything like it.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him. You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class. Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
He's right, Wyatt. Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Praise Jesus!
I'll be dipped in shit. I will, too.
We're the law, ain't we? Well the Law don't ride around vermin
It rides right at 'em. Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Hello, Wyatt! Hiya Doc!
What was that all about?
Are you out of your mind? What on Earth'd make us
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt. I don't know if He's gonna make it.
There's no reasoning with him.
No.
What?
No.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings. Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked. I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package. Can't put it Together for some reason.
Good God, you're really
Cards in spades. I'm in love with Every second of her life. Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
I made a promise.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him. So help me God, I would.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand? You gotta die!
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
I know. Me neither.
All right, what's it to be? New Mexico's that way.
Colorado's closer
So're the Cowboys. They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
All right, I'm on fire! Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
I'm your man... You win again. Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Told you. I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'! Now, red seven. Seven Stinkin' diamonds. Look out! Five Thousand! Let's go!
Awful lot of money.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You're the doctor. sad news, friend.
Damn! All right, wait a minute...
Drunks. Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar. I saw the whole thing.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion? Watch your ear, Creek.
Don't touch me!
Sorry...
You really look awful.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Then why in hell're you doin' This? You ought to be in bed.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't.
I don't believe it. He's clean!
What? But I saw 'em
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
What?
You know, Stephen Foster. "Oh, Susanna". "Camptown Races", Stephenstinkin'Foster!
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
A which?
You know, FredericfuckingChopin.
Doc! How the hell are you?
Perfect, Wyatt. Simply perfect.
Since when is faro a business?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger. The Odds are all with the house.
Depends how you look at it. I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
Very cosmopolitan.
I know him. That's Creek Johnson.
Very instructive
But who was the Devil?
So now we're in the mining Business. Turning into regular Tycoons. Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock. Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
So tell me, Wyatt. I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man? Forsaking all Others?
Well yeah. Pretty much. I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc. I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
I see. And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
You know damn well who I mean. That duskyhued lady Satan.
I don't know. Probably ignore her.
Ignore her?
I'd ignore her. People can Change, Doc.
I'll remember you said that.
Satisfied?
I stand corrected. Wyatt. You're An oak.
He's drunk.
In vino veritas.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
You will or you won't. Don't look To me. I'm going to sleep.
Wyatt! Just in time. Pull up a chair.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
But Doc
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
Sorry, sorry...
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Felt his liver go on that last One. Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!
No...
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt. I Literally don't care if I live or Die. But even I can't fight human Instinct. Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
I don't know. It all happened so Fast. If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
Doc...
Don't touch me, God damn it! Just Don't touch me! Come on...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it. He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it. And it drives him mad. Sick mad. Cold and dirty.
So what does he want?
What does he want? He wants revenge.
Revenge? For what?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wyatt. God, I'm so sorry.
That's all right, Doc. Don't worry.
Never got to wear one of those.
Well hell, Wyatt. Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney. Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome. You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree? A better one might be how Do you feel?
Hurts. Hurts pretty bad.
I imagine it would, yes. So now We can add selfpity to your list Of frailties.
All right, Doc...
You think I'm kidding. You're the Most fallible, wrongheaded, self Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known. Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
When will you wake up? You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
That's great coming from you.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt. Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's. Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life. There's Only life, that's all. Just life. The rest is relative.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black Haired woman and make her your own.
All right. Then what?
Run. Take that girl and start Running. Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By. This time run and don't look Back and call it living. Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt. Live, Wyatt... Live for me.
Here, Doc.
Bless you, darling Darling! Are you mad? You're not Wearing a bustle. How lewd!
I calculate that's the end of This town. And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
You don't even know him.
Yes, but there's just something About him. Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me. No. I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
That's my lovin' man. Just can't Get enough.
Enough? Never.
What's wrong, Doc?
Nothing. Not a thing. I'm right As the mail.
How you feeling, Doc?
Better.
That's good. I knew it wasn't nothin'.
We must talk, darling. It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
What's that mean, Doc? You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that. You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Not exactly...
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me. I'm A good woman.
Yes, I know. You are a good woman.
That's the rumor.
You retired, too?
Not me. I'm in my prime.
Yeah, you look it.
And you must be Ringo. Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo. The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say. What do you Think, darling? Should I hate him?
Age quod agis.
Credat Judaeus Apella.

That's just my game.
All right, lunger. Have at it.
On three? You call it.

I was kidding about that.
All right, lunger. Let's do it.
Say when.
Forget it.
Excuse me?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final. I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me. Good day.
But wait, you don't understand
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition. Forever. I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life. That is if you don't Mind. Jesus. Good day now.

Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
I'm retired.
Good. That's real good.
Come on, you...
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull. Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Feel bad about ol' Fred. Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly. Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square. Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge. I Deserved a rap in the head.
Make you a deal. My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone. Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans. You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Fair enough. You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
They were all gonna jump me back There. What ever happened to one Against one?
Ain't our way. We go all on one, One on all. Fight one of us, you Fight us all. That's the Cowboy way.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys? Cowhands ride for the brand.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right. This brand. How 'bout you?
This brand.
We're gonna get along just fine.
I'm sorry. If there was any other
I know. Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike. Don't worry about it.

Look at that! Yeah! Come and get Some, boy!
No...
Let me, let me, yeah! Die, you Bastard...
No...
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us? Didn't make No sense.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Shut up, Ike.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
I want them spitting blood!
Easy, Johnny. Now ain't the time. I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit! God have mercy!
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world! I want To die!
Easy, son. You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All. Come on, boy, let's kick South. Down to the old playground.
Hey, you smell that? Smells like Something died.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
He said to turn loose of him.
Well I'm not so go home.
Where'd you get that horse?
Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.
Where do you think? I stole him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back. One way Or another.
Come and get him.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too. Even stole a Horse once. But you can't
The man dealing faro. Who is he?
That's Wyatt Earp. Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Yes, very. And very married.
Oh, so that's it...
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment. Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next. Who know? You might find a Future here.
Maybe even my destiny.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Absolutely nothing.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Not now. I don't have time.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight. Listen to Me! You're mine! Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
My man? You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men. Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man? You're Just a dirty little fixer.
You whore! You filthy whore!
Easy. I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here. Lots of socalled Hard cases and toughnuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play. None of 'em.
I don't understand.
You will after tonight. Bet on it.
Newcomers, eh? Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff. Just Hit town?
Just this minute. I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Gave all that up. Going into business.
Well I'm the man to see. Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Nonpartisan Anti Chinese league. A man of many Parts. Got a place to stay yet? I Also sit on the Townlot Commission. Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent. Here, let me show you...
So how's Tombstone treating you?
Fine, fine. But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
What d'you think of the singer?
Nice voice.
That's not what I meant.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday. In or out?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst. Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call. Cover your ears, darling.
God damn son of a...
Isn't that a daisy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me. Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say! Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore? You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Oh, my God...
Does it hurt? A lot? Good.
Everything in order, sir? What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Telegrams.
Wellget a move on yerthen get back to yer station.
Nothin'.
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
Heyyou! Where you going?
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Because you ran after me.
I thought I had our sailing covered up and here it is.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
Sure, Sis.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
I'm all right.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I was in his cabin
What!are you crazy?
I'll explain later
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck
There you are, sir.
Thank you.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
He's certainly goodnatured.
"Smooth's" the word.
I meana lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
What's the matter?
Nothin I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Good night!
Congratulations.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Sure I wouldbut I don't get what you're driving at.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
That's the truthevery single word!
I sincerely hope so
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
For a very excellent reason from your own admission I'm not saying you <U>did</U>but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me outI got to win that fifty bucks.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Goodnight.
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Yes, Yes!
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
No!
S'pose you've never thought of killing him
I wouldn't say that I'm glad he's deadyesI'd thought of killing him but I didn't
Why?
Because I was yellow, I guess
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but
This is interesting Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
All rightbut what is there to face? It's finished.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you againthat's my privilege.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me I'd have found youno matter where you were.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Because I want youwill always want youno other woman'll ever take your place. I want you more now than I did that first night You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
I wish I could.
Get wise to yourself, Sallyyou're no sob story.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistakeWellyou're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!Get that!And what're you going to do about it?
That's more like the old Sallya little bit of fire. How about Ned?
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and
you'd go with him!
Don't kid yourselfyou know how I stand back there.
Not because of Ned.
Of course not but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinctwhere they made the squawk?
You can't bluff me any more.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it. What do you want me to do?
Just smile again and be reasonable. I'll order dinner herejust the two of uslike old times.
and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
That's a betbut I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back therejust thinking about you
Don't, Leethat's dead.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Go aheadyou didn't used to be so fussy
I've lost my taste for knickknacks
Don't be a mug all your lifeI'm trying to help you you need me more than I need youhave you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Not a chanceI'm through.
You're wasting your timeshe's a friend of mine.
Eh?... Oh.
He works the boats as a "comeon" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly. I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicagorelated to one of the big packin' familieson his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Looks lonesomeBring him over here.
Can you read 'em Jack?
They're a cinch to readQueen of Clubs Ace of Diamonds.
The man that marks them is an artisttwo hundred and fifty bucks for six decksand they're worth it.
The country boy's about due.

Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman windowthe Scotchman says to the window"Gee you're tight." and the window says"You loosen up a bit and so will I."Good?And then I do the one Ohyou don't like it, eh?
ChadLother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally
Oh!So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Nobut I'm going to keep my eye on
What happened to you?
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?

Is that one of the Who's Who?
NoHe's probably one of the "Here's How." Take it easythe ocean's pretty rough today
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this showDon't you know there's a rehearsal going on? And you wanted a raise.Come onget going or you'll get it!
Oh, all right See you later, Toots.
Oh, Chadwhat about the rest of the show?
Oh,I was having so much fun I almost forgot
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet
Goodnight, folks.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
What do you mean?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
OhI understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Meaning what?
You don't shoot squirrels.
Well, that's somethingeven if only the fish can see it.
Are you happy?
Will beas soon as the ship sails.
Am I a member of this club?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo Get out of here.
Everything O.K.?
Just what the doctor ordered.
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Like it?
SwellYou've got Times Square right hereall but the noises
Yepspending lots of time aboardyou see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
And you've put it overhaven't you?
Why not? I give 'em a great showand you know We're doing capacity, Sallyand all <U>Nice</U> people
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Nonot muchexcepting
Still got my picture, I seeI was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
NoInexperienced A redheaded kidhomemade clothesBroadway was Paradiseand a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this
Do what
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' noticeyou never asked why, but I guess you know.
News travels fast on Broadwayyou had to get away from a rat
It wasn't only thatNed was in a jam.
I get itLee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I was so crazy about himanything he did or said was O.K. by me. I introduced him to peopleeven after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matterI didn't care until he roped Ned in. Some confidence gameand the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Nedtried to make a breakLee wouldn't stand for it andwellhere I am!
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of monthsyou'll soon forget all about it.
Chad Denby broadcasting the nicest man I ever knew
But not nice enough to marryeh?
Come on, nowyou've forgotten all about that.
I'll never love anybody else.
Women are such fools!Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
Guess they're dullnothing for you to reform.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Yes.
Very serious?
Very
Whydon't you like him?
Of coursebut There's your cuehurry up
McKinney's the name.
Miss Marsh.
Here we are, folkseighty thousand wildeyed fans go madthey go mad as Chad Denbywith the arms of iron, and the nerves of steelpicks up his racket What is this thinga racket or a mallet?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world maybe we could finish this game. Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffleboard.
Yeahif he'd only stick to shuffleboard.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!
It must be the sea airit gets everybody.
He's a likable chaphe's got an honest face
It's all rightif you like honest faceslet's have another drinkSteward!
Oh noI don't want to impose on you It's funny about that billfoldI could have sworn I had it
Hello, InspectorI hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the waywhat do you know about him?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Oh, nothingonly I wondered why you suspected him.
Well, I'll tell youwe picked him up about a year ago but could never pin anything on him.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Yeah
I didn't
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yesbut I didn't give it to him
Is this your gun?
Yes!
He's funnymaybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
<U>Denby!</U>Are you Chad Denby?
Oh, there you are
That's rightyou're the one I was looking for. You'll excuse me. How about you and I being alone?
Not now, TootsWhich is the right way to say this? You're dumber than meoryou're dumber than I?
Let me see nowDon't tell me You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Never mind.
I'll sayhow fast is this boat going?
Oh,we're doing about thirty
Pretty goodthirty <U>miles</U> an hour
No. <U>Knots</U>!
What?
Knots!
I can see you're no gentleman
That's me!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?
YesMein person!
So what?
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
Hello, Denby!
I thought I put you to bed.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Well, did you find me?
Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Hey, boygive this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
She's in New York.
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
That's fine.
Come on, get up. That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Who won?
Well, you got the first downthere's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
I was never stiffer in my life.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot
Here you are, sir.
What'll I say?
Eighty cents a wordthreesixnine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too muchI'll show you how to save some money.
How?
Where do you live?
In New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Then you don't have to tell hercut out New York.
"Will be back in four weeks" that saves you eighty cents right there!
That's righthere's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the companysend it right off.
Wait a minuteI think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
How?
"Willbebackinfourweeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Wait a minuteI think I can cut something else out. "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"say "next month"That saves another word.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Just a minuteI don't think we need the word "Back" Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Back is in New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Sure.
Cut it out.
Now we get it down to two words"next month."
Send that.
Wait a minuteWhat <U>is</U> next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
O.K.! Send that!
Just a minuteYour wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it. See thatI saved you seven twenty!
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Their faces are familiarbut not to each other.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
NoI'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
Tell you what I'll do. I'll toss you for herheads she plays with me.
O.K. Heads you win.
That's too bad.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minutelet's match for it.
Never mindI'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Oh, Denbyhave you seen Sally around?
NoI'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is
She was to meet me herewhy don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I wouldbut our rehearsal starts right away. Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some daynot nowwhen you get a chancelet her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. Is she entertaining you?
I should say not.
Good! At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
I won'tI'll ask for one right now. Sally tells me she's in love with you.
She did?
Yesbut don't ask me whybecause I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of lifebut <U>that</U> would be enough for meI wouldn't care about easy moneyorshowing off my smart brainsI'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>Do I make myself clear?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
O.K., kid I'm only sorry for one thing.
What's that?
If you hadn't agreedI was going to throw you overboard
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Nonot quite.
I'm going to the show
I'll go with you
Care to join us?
No, thanksI never gambled in my life.
This is excitingbut if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector
Sorrybut I'm on a vacation
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing Bet I could find that bracelet
I wouldn't be surprised
I wouldn't worry about itit'll turn up How about a nightcap, Inspector?
No, thanksI'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in
Good night!
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
How about you?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
You know what I'd do, if I were youbefore the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Why?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this eveningeven the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
Swell!
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
This has nothing to do with me But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this run your fingers all along these seams.... Then back of the collar<U>here</U>that used to be a favorite trickand never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoelike this.
Hey!you're tickling me.
Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs like thisin case they got what you're looking for attached to a string. See what I mean, Purser?
Hello, young fellow!
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nooooo!going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.
Wouldn't bet against her. Tell you what I will dobet you I find that bracelet before we hit France. Not a hundred, thoughjust fifty.
It's a betcome on, Sally!
Nice girl, that I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal. You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it backI'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Thought you might need medon't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you
Don't be too smart, Jimmyyou're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killedbut I'll deal with that later
Don't get yourself all worked up
You keep out of this You admit you thought of killing himhow were you going to do it?
Mmmmmmmmmhm.... Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Why, I
Here's your fifty.
Thanks. That makes us square.
Come in!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I'll bet a couple of hundred I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Don't worry about that. We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Three Jacks.
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
It's your deal.
It's a pleasure.
How's your mother feeling?
Much betterthank you
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
I thought you were a sucker
Think again
That goes two ways.
Make it three, boysI'll play this hand pat.
Not herefollow me around the shed.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
We coulda got two thirdclass!
No bank roll there, boy. Lucky I could get you signed onthey picked up that Pittsburgh jewelermade him talk. The heat's on, Shortieand those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
It'll never hurt youGot any money?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
I'll give you half of it. Here's seventy cents.
Nix, the law!
Yes, sir!I will, sirCertainly, sir!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
I'll watch for him, sir.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Oh, noYou're not gonna give my hardearned money away.
You're a wise guyGimme back
Shortie, look!
You don't think?
Looks like he's taking a tripsee the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grillinglet's see how good his memory is.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmymy feet'll never hold out.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Yeahbut high livin's made me soft.
How're the tips?
A dollar forty.
I'll need itgave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Not a chance.
Come on I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Until thenthe dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job it's a marathon.
Oh, Shortie! there's a girl on this ship
there's thousands of 'em!
A thousand? She's one in a millionright off the top of the rosebush!
This is a business trip!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. Funnyher name's not on the passenger list.
Maybe she's in the showOne of the troupersdid you ever think of that?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Just a minute, stewardhaven't you forgotten something?
No, sir?
My change.
Change?
A dollar fortyout of the two dollars I gave you.
Shortie!you know my motto?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Right!but it doesn't have to apply to youKeep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Now you're talkin'!
Inspector McKinney.
Are you screwy?
I fell in his armsCouldn't resist it.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days
Heredrop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
You take some awful chances.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
They won't squawkthey're professionals.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of handsBut what about after that?
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie
Have the purser give you twentyfive hundred dollars for this checkand bring the cash here.
Yes, Mr. Brettright away.
Here's your twentyfive hundred, Mr. Brett.
Thank you. I owe you a dollar fortyherekeep the change.
Thank you, sir.
I'll take one.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Oh, is she? What a shame! You'll pardon me?
About sixteen hundred.
Partners, ain't we?
Sureand to show you I'm a regular fella Here's that twentyfive hundred.
You keep it
<U>Me</U>!
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you
Saywait a minute!
See you later, ShortieI'm off to the pool.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Listen, RuntQuick! Where's the ice?
WhyIer thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.
Get it!
I'm so sorry!
Want to take it back?
I thought you were one of my friends.
I'd <U>like</U> to be. Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Yesare you?
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
I'll say she is!
Nice lines
Yes
Like her paint job?
Very much
You've got lipstick all over you.
I could stand some more
You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you let me wipe it off.
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Where have you been hiding?
Ohhello! I got the flowers. That was sweet of youthank you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
So you washed it off!
How about giving me another coat?
Goodby.
Wait a minute!They're dancing in the palm court
Goodby!
There's soft music
sorrygot an appointment to play shuffleboard.
Have we?Well, I'd just as soon play shuffleboard.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>up here in the moonlight.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Awgive a feller a break. My cards are on the table I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Never eat before the show.
Wellbreakfast? Lunch?
This is Mr.er
Brett is the name.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Don't stop, nurseI think I'm going to faint.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>looking girl. In factI think you're lovely.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Married?
Nothing to speak of. What is thisthird degree?
I want you to get used to my voiceyou're going to hear it a lot.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Tell me.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and
you want to adopt him!Good for you!
Isn't she attractive?
Veryyour mother?
Don't be a cat.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?
At seventhirty?
Sooner it you like.
Okay.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Wrong again But I dislike possessive women.
See you at seventhirty in the lounge.
I'll be thereGoodby.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
I must say you're persistent it's kind of flattering.
A little.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Anything I can do? I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
Decent? I guess any guy could be decentif you were interested.
What are you thinking?
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
That's funnyso was I. Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
I can't blame the oceanit's you.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
For once I'm dead on the level crazy about you!
Will you take some advice? If you're looking for romancecount me out if you know what's good for you.
But
I know what I'm talking about. I'm no highschool girl looking through a windowreaching for the moon. Guess I'll be going.
Sally!
Let's forget itcan't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
Don't let's talk about it.
You said it! How about a little action?
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Yesis it all right if I come like this?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Lonesome?
We'll let it go at that
What, again?
Yesyou know what I've been thinking, Sally?
What?
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You didn't?I guess I forgot to tell you
You're a little ahead of yourselfthe usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones setwhat do you think?
I think we ought to walk.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
Good night, idiot!
I could see you were pining away
Oh, that's Mrs. Rossonremember, you met her yesterday?
YesI remember
How well do you know her?
Just met her on the boatsupposed to play bridge with her yesterdaybut she wouldn'tso we played poker instead.
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?I won a little
That was the comeonpromise me you won't play with them again
What do you know about them?
Too muchRememberI warned you about me I used to be Lee Lother's girl
You can live that down, can't you?
He's a con mancrooked as a treeand I was part of the rackethelped him! Nowif you have an appointment elsewhereI'll excuse you!
You can't lose me, SallyI'm no lily myself!
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Come onlet's take a swim.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Make it five.
Sevenfifty. Positively my last offer.
I'll be waiting on deck.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Jimmy!
Well, I'll be!!!
What's the matter?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
We'll be expecting you.
We haven't any chips, Mr. BrettDo you mind playing with cash?
Not at all.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
I should pass, but I'll trail alongI'll take three.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Aces full.
And me coming in with two pair
You're coming back
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
How about a little game later?
FineI'll be glad to.
Could I see you a minute?
Sure! Excuse me.
No gentleman would do that.
I agree with youno gentleman, wouldBut I would especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
In that caseyou owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Oh, noI played with <U>your</U> cardsin <U>your</U> cabinat <U>your</U> suggestionIf you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonightyou'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'emWhy, a highschool kid could take you sapsand another thingLay off Sally Marsh. "Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
Where'd you get it?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Stickup. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Guess again, copper.
Get moving
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from out in Montanawe have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Montana?
Lumber, ma'amspent all my life out there piling up a bank balance and now gosh darn it"Honest Jack"that's what they call meis goin' to see the world.
that's what we call doublea grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Isn't that interesting?
You'll excuse me.
Well, it'll have to be pokerbut I'm so unlucky in that game.
Will you pardon me?
<U>Gladly</U>.
You're luckyout my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless see you later.
Did you find it?
No!Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Noo!
Where's Lother?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache. and it's so noisy up here.
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise. Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Feeling a little better, I see.
Yes, yesthe air I'm getting plenty of air. Miss MarshMrs. Rosson.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seventhirty?
Soonerif you like. See you again, I hope.
Good afternoon
Glad to see you again.
I hope so.
That's a date.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Thanks.
Isn't she lovely?
Yesand <U>very</U> popular
NoI'm furious!Nobody seems to do anything about it
Why worry? It was insuredhow about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Anya!
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do. We can't stand here.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there made my plansI'd have sent for you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
It would be a nice change from you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anythingeven when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice
How'd you ever get away with it?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nervesa few tearsand Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Sure!
I never want to go back....
Here's to Europe! Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Don't be crazyI'm tickled to death to see you.
That's finebecause you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something. Shall I see you tomorrow?
Hope we're not intruding.
This is Miss Marsh.
YesI met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances. What's the matter, Miss Marsharen't you feeling well?
Wellshall we go into dinner?
I'll join you later.
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York. Ohthere's no accounting for tastes Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
I can explain
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Leeit interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette. What did you dopersuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like herwhat're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me
Oha hundred times
and I can tell you where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert. Take it easy, Leeno other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in mebecause I like you. You're such a swine!
Will you leave me alone?
I like touching youpoison ivy. You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Baloney!
No, darling, lip rougeall over your mouth.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into 
Excuse me.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
It's so unfair.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Rose, get in the boat!
Goodbye, mother.
Is your stateroom alright?
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn't that right, sweetie.
Would you like anything?
I should like to see my drawing.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heartlike shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. See the date?
It's been 84 years...
Just tell us what you can 
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Don't come any closer.
You had it the entire time?!
April 14, 1912.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
That's enough.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
You think she was really there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I'm sorry.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Yes sir.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
No you won't.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
You're distracting me. Go away.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
The fall alone would kill you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
How cold?
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
No.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice fishing's where you chop a hole in the 
I know what ice fishing is!
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
You're crazy.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
I'm Jack Dawson.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
I've got you. I won't let go.
Hello again.
Could I speak to you in private?
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
So, you got a name by the way?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Mr. Dawson, I 
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Well, here you are.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
You're welcome. Rose.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Yes, exactly!
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
What's this?
Just some sketches.
May I?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
And these were drawn from life?
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
She had beautiful hands.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
No, no! Just with her hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
I see you.
And...?
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
A whole ten cents?!
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that sidesaddle stuff.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Sure. If you like.
I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Jack, must you go?
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
May I cut in, miss?
You're still my best girl, Cora.
I don't know the steps.
Just move with me. Don't think.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I did, didn't I? Look! A shooting star.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and 
Jack, I 
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
You're right. Only you can do that.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Fabrizio said you might be up 
Sssshh. Come here.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. Hey... Monet!
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
What is it? A sapphire?
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
He does landscapes.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
He's an exPinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Kinda like we're doin' right now  uh oh!
Where to, Miss?
To the stars.
Are you nervous?
Au contraire, mon cher.
You're trembling.
It's okay. I'm alright.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
This is crazy.
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Could it have damaged the ship?
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
It's bad.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
Now it's worse.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Right.
This is horseshit.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you 
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
He couldn't have.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
I know, I know.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.
You have to go for help.
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.
Will this work?
We'll find out.
I'm not going without you.
Get in the boat, Rose.
You jump, I jump, right?
Right.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
It's so cold.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
It's getting quiet.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
No... don't say your goodbyes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I'm so cold.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I can't feel my body.
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
I promise.
Never let go.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
No, but we're making excellent time.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Why have we stopped?
We've struck ice.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Excuse me.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go. Well come on!
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
Bollocks.
Well I can.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. Sorry Fabrizio.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo 
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!! Capito?? I go to America!!
You know somebody?
Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
How you two doin'?
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
The boats are all going.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.
Good. Settled then.
This should be amusing.
Can I bum a cigarette?
Just a soupcon of lemon... ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
You're a good liar.
Almost as good as you.
I always win, Jack. One way or another. Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
You told me to change.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I felt like black.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? Picasso.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
An accident?!
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
My God... Cal. Is it a 
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the 
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
I was tired.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee 
Something serious has happened.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back... ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other. Search him.
But I was with him the whole time.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Oh, Mother shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Not the better half.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you 
Is this in any way unclear?
What do I tell your mother?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
You're precious to me, Rose.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. Mind your step.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
She knows.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
None of the stewards have seen her.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... ...isn't letting any men in at all.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. Come on.
I make my own luck.
So do I.
We're too late.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
What could possible be funny?
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
The partners want to know how it's going?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
There's a satellite call for you.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Rose Calvert.
...Mrs. Calvert?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Don't you mean work me?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. You see this? Right here?
What?
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B54.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
I'm tryin' boss.
Who's the best? Say it.
You are, Lewis. You rolling?
Shit.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Get that outta my face.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
A hundred and one next month.
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? That's great!
Lewis...
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
It's hers, you schmuck. Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Thank you, Rose.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here. But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was overruled.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
The ship will sink.
You're certain?
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hurry, Rose.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Good luck to you, Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
That's right.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
The pumps 
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
How much time?
An hour, two at most.
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
He started it.
But you're the more intelligent one.
That's true.
Then why did you do it?
Because I hate himbecause I love you!
You should have more selfcontrol. You were in the army.
Well, he was in the navy.
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
NoI'm sorry.
But you saw it here.
Yes, I saw itbut
Well, where is it?
You've had your breakfastoh, but of course you have.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early. My little brother goes to school You see, Mother is dead.
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Two lumps, madame?
Please! Thank you.
May I?
Yes, madame?
You see Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
About what?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Naturally not!
Now. Uhmademoisellein the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Welluhyes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous? Umhum. He smokes too much!
No, he <u>works</u> too much. He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office
Yes! And he would have a little more time for
For all the really important things
Right!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usualfive o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrantI insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>remember!
Very well, madame. Thank you.
Yes, madame?
How much is your salary?
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!
I think you'd better go.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Gautieror whatever your name isI thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money
I don't want your money!
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them toto
To M'sieu Laval?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years. I was a school friend of your husband's ...
I know!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Jacques!
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yesuh
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something. Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
What is it, madame?
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
No, m'sieu!
Yes, madame!
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over. It's only ten o'clock.
Yes...?
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Yes.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Then you go into the foyer.
Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I know that niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I remember.
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
Neither do I. That's where I found it.
I don't know how I could have lost it there. I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybeare you sure this is your bag?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bagone has to be careful.
WellI am Madame Colet.
And I am M'sieu Lavalif you will allow me to introduce myself.
Wellhow do you do, M'sieu Laval?
The pleasure is mine, madame.
One purse empty. One vanity case
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue? Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and Oh, yes, this letter from Major
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
Oh!
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
M'sieu Laval!
But one suggestion, madame. Not the major. I don't mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mysteryno bouquetno ... And one lipstick ... Scarlet number four.
What's wrong now?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
No, no, no! I disagree with you completely! I tried it once
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Goodbye, M'sieu La Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Yes.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story shorta member of the nouveaux poor.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately.
Do you know my first name?
No. What is it? Tell me.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
What?
Make it out to cash!
As you like.
Eighteenth century.
Yes!
Early eighteenth century. I should say aroundseventeen thirty.
Right!
Beautiful specimen.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Oh?
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see. She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Isn't that wonderful! You see, madame
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francsin your safeat <u>home</u>?
You think that's too much?
No! Not enough! In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
That sounds sensible.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag
Then I mislay my checkbook
Then you use the wrong lipstick
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father which, fortunately, I am not
Yees?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spankingin a business way, of course.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
The same thing.
You're hired!
Madame.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
I'll be delighted.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Yes, madame?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Umhum ...
Then riding together.
Umhum ...
Then lunch in the Bois
Together.
Then a little nap
How do you like my dress?
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Crimson!
Correct! Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Goodbye.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Talk? About meabout us?
Precisely.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Noyours, madame.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all! I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputationlike that!
You would?
Yes, I would!
Like that?
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
You're conceited
But attractive
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u><u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>! Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Then why do you want to go?
Because I want to make it tough for you.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
On the night table.
But I don't want to be a lady.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Please!
Thirtythree
Nothirtyfive!
Yes, Gaston?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anythingI would act.
Call the police?
Instantly.
Um<u>hum</u> ...
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Seventysix, eighty
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
You have been robbedfor years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
And you expect me to believe that?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
Why not? He's a thiefhe's a criminal.
I don't believe it!
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Giron...!
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Girondistinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police? I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way upa selfmade crook then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!"
Goodbye...
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Divine ...
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrantthen you'll be glad you're alone.
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Goodbye ...
Who?
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded. Baron, I shouldn't have come!
But you came. And you must forget everything except that you are here, Countess.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Nono.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
I would like to.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like mebut I don't care!
Why should you?
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Thank you!
Someone from another worldso entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own classprinces and counts and dukes and kingsah! And everybody talking shopalways trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Disappointed?
Noproud. Very proud!
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses his head.
Please. When I came here it was for a little adventurea little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed meand it isn't the champagne. The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you. Baron, you are a crook. You robbed the gentleman in two fiftythree, five, seven, and nine. May I have the salt?
Please.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
You're very welcome. Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart Countess, you are a thief. The wallet of the gentleman in two fiftythree, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket. In fact, you tickled me. But your embrace was so sweet ...
I like you, Baron.
I'm crazy about you. By the way, your pin.
Thank you, Baron.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
What time is it?
Darling! Now tell metell me all about yourself. Who are you?
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Monescu!
Gaston Monescu.
Gaston!
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Last year? It can't be that long.
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Right.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The fourteenth of May.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow
The six
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Two fiftythree, five
Seven and nine!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Darling!
the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody. Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're brokeall right. I might pick up a millionfranc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>why take a chance on jewelry?
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
What?
But it's not enough!
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at heruh
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it? Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open itright now! Let's get away from here! I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month. It's only ten days ... Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, robbut don't become one of those useless, goodfornothing gigolos!
Filiba ...

Correct. Now the train leaves
At twelve twenty. I know. Lyons two, four, seven, one. Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!

I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the stationmidnight. Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!

Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
That's what I'm here forto get out! I want to get away from here, from youas fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me. Sixtyfive, ninetyfour

Thirtyfive to the leftsixty three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventysix, eightyfour, fiftyfive What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
But, Lily
Don't you dare lie to me! I know you love me. Well, why don't you say something? Come onbe brilliant. Talk yourself out of itbluff yourself in! Shut up, you liar, you! That's what I want! This is real! Money! Cash!
And you
Lily
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her. Well she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twentyfive thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
GoodbyeMadame Colet and Company!
Lily!
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major.
Good day, Doctor.
Good day, Major.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Now just a minute, Major
No, Captain, I tell you
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Umhum ...
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Just a second.
I hope you find the figures correct.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Two weeks and three days.
Umhum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron
I've got to see you.
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron
No, to youM'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Yes, m'sieu.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Very well, m'sieu.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu. M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about about sixtyfive. Let's see You will be exactly eightyseven when you come out of prison.
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police? I'll tell you whyyou crook, you.
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
Yes, sir? What shall we start with, Baron?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Julietwho might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I would start with cocktails.
Umhum. Very good. Excellent!
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
Yes, Baron.
And, waiteryou see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
Yes, Baron. Moon in champagne.
I want to see
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter
Yes, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!
No, Baron! I beg your pardon.
Thank you.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You can trust me.
Yes, Baron. Thank you.
Good morning, Major.
Good morning. I'dI'dI'd like to look at some cuff links.
Nice day, Major.
Umm.
You're looking fine, Major.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
No doubt about itit's that secretary.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparklebut dependable.
The type they marry.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Nice suit.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I thought so.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Just dull.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Funnythe first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Doc!
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Wellthen it must be my mistake. I beg your pardon.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
You see No, no! And <u>yet</u> <u>Did</u> Ididnow <u>where</u> could we have
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No ... Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
You've never been in Constantinople?
No!
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
But
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas
And harems ... ?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting twouhtwo business associates.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A finelooking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
No!
<u>Niente!</u>
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
What did you talk about?
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Where did you find it?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
No!
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
Eleven o'clock!
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
Very well, Jacques.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
At once, Jacques. We'll continue later.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
In a moment.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible! And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.
Yes, M'sieu Laval!
What? I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye! Yes?
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Well, have you found it?
No! But let me tell youany woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbagphooey, phooey, phooey!
Captain...
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for backup?
Sir, I
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie
I'll do it.
What?
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Yes, sir.
Sir...
I thought I told you
What's this?
Report on the case so far.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes, sir.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
I didn't. But I had to try.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business
I know.
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Reilly, what the hell are you?
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Reilly, Vice. I
Quiet!
Make an appointment.
It's about this.
P.E.T.N ...
What?
Vice cop on a homicide?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Device.
Huh?
A what?
IRA  instant retirement account.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
You mean you just? ... You keep a record of... matches?
T.J., what're you doing?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Nice to be here.
That feeling won't last long.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Look who's talking, old man.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Next week we work the park.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
You don't fish.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what'shername's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gungho, we'd best call it in for some backup.
Nah, let's just take a looksee.
You okay?
Yeah, just a nick ...
Mike...
Don't talk.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
It don't work
Ain't that a shit
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Vice... Jesus.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Pooch, can you move it?
I don't know...
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Shit. We're fucked.
Oh shit...
Fuck factor ten.
He is!
Look, it's important.
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
What kind of bomb was it?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Insurance?
How're you guys doing?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
Prints?
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
What the hell's going on?
Sonofabitch... my nose... This fuckup is interfering with
Reilly, what're you doing here?
I'm filing charges against that mother
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
I want to work this.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
But sir
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Maybe she knows your old man.
What the hell was that?
A ticking bomb...
You touch me again and
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
You okay?
Alex
I know. I warned them.
What is that?
Security.
What's the matter?
Nothing... just tired.
Why are we stopping here?
