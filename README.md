**seq2seq** is my first time attempting to create an AI chatbot.

## Training
To train it, simply change the parameters at the top in train.py and run it. Make sure you have the datasets!

## Chatting
To chat with a completed model, make sure the model and the tokenizer are in /models and run chat.py

I also included some example datasets
